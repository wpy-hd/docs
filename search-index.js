When these changes are officially rolled into the next publicly-available release of the DFINITY Canister SDK, they will change how you build and deploy applications on the Internet Computer. If you are creating new projects, the changes to the underlying architecture will have little, if any, effect on your development workflow. In fact, you might find that the new architecture makes building applications that run on the 互联网计算机 a more familiar experience. If you have any existing projects, however, you’ll need to plan for a one-time migration to the new architecture. Migration to the new architecture doesn’t have to be completed immediately, but updating your projects to take advantage of the changes will ultimately make it easier to upload and manage front-end assets. Before we describe the new architecture, it’s useful to have some context about the old approach that we are replacing and how the code has worked up to this point. Previously, developing a front-end on the Internet Computer involved adding a front-end assets canister with a retrieve() function. The retrieve() function would take a path and return a blob. The blob returned by the retrieve() function would then have an index.js file that contained some JavaScript and static HTML called the bootstrap code. After you deployed an application as smart contract—called a canister—on the Internet Computer, accessing the canister using the .ic0.app URL executed the bootstrap code, which in turn, performed the following steps: Created a secure worker to contain your private key. Polyfilled the window.ic to provide some mechanics to the running application so that it can communicate with the Internet Computer. Called the canister’s retrieve() method with index.js as the path, and evaluate it. Passed control of the document object model (DOM) and the page to the canister’s JavaScript code. This bootstrap workflow is quite different from how people usually build web applications. For example, this approach did not support loading HTML directly or downloading assets like PNG files. Asset handling required either loading the assets from another domain (for example, an AWS bucket) or loading the assets in JavaScript, transforming them into data URI, then setting the src attribute accordingly. Handling assets in this way led to problems in the browser, such as: Not waiting for re-layout of pages. Deferred loading of assets. Executing JavaScript out of band. The bootstrap approach provided advantages in terms of security and decentralization, but those advantages were offset by the poor HTTP and asset handling that front-end developers and application users didn’t expect to experience. Over the last year, the DFINITY Canister SDK team has been gathering and evaluating feedback from the developer community. Based on that feedback, the team has decided to provide a more flexible developer experience while continuing to provide an equivalent security model. After considering the advantages and disadvantages of different proposals, the team decided on an architecture that would allow canisters to answer HTTP requests directly. With this new approach, the DFINITY Canister SDK implements an HTTP middleware server. The HTTP middleware server handles the processing for the HTTP request by doing the following: Receiving the HTTP request and converting its method, uri, headers and body into a Candid structure. Resolving the canister identifier for the request. Instantiating an agent to talk to the canister. Calling an http_request() query method. If the canister implements the http_request() method, the HTTP middleware decodes the response, takes the headers and body, and constructs an HTTP response. If the canister does not implement the http_request() method, for backward compatibility, the middleware returns a bootstrap polyfill that points out the deprecation as a warning. For any errors in the process, the HTTP middleware returns the following error codes: 400 Bad Request for any invalid requests (for example, if the HTTP middleware could not find or decode a canister ID). 500 Internal Server Error for errors from the HTTP middleware itself (for example, if it could not connect to a replica) 502 Bad Gateway if an error is coming from the replica itself (including canister trapping). If any of these errors occur, the dfx command-line interface provides additional details in the response body. To make this transition easier, new and existing projects built with the newer version of dfx will include an improved asset canister that supports the http_request() method by default. This means that assets you upload—including binary assets like images—will be available directly from your browser using their URL. For example, in a new project, the sample-asset.txt file would be uploaded and available after publishing to the Internet Computer at https://.raw.ic0.app/sample-asset.txt. In the future, we will also provide additional support for managing the asset canister cache, handling default assets, and providing HTTP-specific features. Both the /api (for replicas) and /_ (for tool purposes) routes are reserved by the HTTP request specification. All other routes are available for you to use as needed within your application, eliminating the need to rely on a separate hash router. Before going into how to migrate an existing project, let’s take a look at a new project. The front-end changes include the following: The dfx.json includes a frontend key for the asset canister that now points to an index.html file instead of the index.js JavaScript entry point. The package.json file now supports Webpack 5 by default. The webpack.config.js file now generates the list of canister imports for for each canister that has a frontend key in a different way. The src/_assets/src/index.html file is a new template file that you can replace with your own index.html file for your front-end. It is served by default by the asset canister when a file isn’t found. The index.js file has been modified to support agent and actor creation. With the new architecture, we explicitly create an agent instance, then create the actor that we’ll use for our canister. In the index.js file, this means that where before there was only one import from files generated by dfx, now there are two. For example, the new index.js file in a project provides code similar to this: import { Actor, HttpAgent } from '@dfinity/agent'; import { idlFactory as example_idl, canisterId as example_id } from 'dfx-generated/example'; const agent = new HttpAgent(); const example = Actor.createActor(example_idl, { agent, canisterId: example_id }); Explicitly creating the agent and actor like this example illustrates is better for a couple reasons: First, the agent itself is entirely configurable by the application, and so is the actor. For example, authentication can only be set when the agent is constructed, so if you want to manage a user identity, you’ll need to do it before creating the agent. Second, being explicit about creating the agent and actor gives you much more control over when you instantiate those objects. If you want a React hook or an Angular service to create the actor, this approach allows you to do so easily. If you have an existing project, chances are it will not work seamlessly after you update the DFINITY Canister SDK. Unfortunately, a direct migration path isn’t possible in this case. The best way to migrate your current front-end is to create a new project and move your code manually to the new structure. With the launch of the 互联网计算机 main network Beta, all projects serve front-end assets use the new HTTP query architecture. In addition, the 互联网计算机 launch introduces a new capability to serve front-end assets as certified data that has been signed and can be considered authenticated and secure or as raw, uncertified data. Front-end assets that don’t go through the certification process are served using the raw.ic0.app URL suffix. Certified front-end assets use the .ic0.app URL suffix. All of the current tutorials illustrate applications that serve uncertified front-end assets. Learning how to build an application that uses certified query results for front-end assets is an advanced development topic. For information about how to return certified data in response to queries, see the Interface specification and connect with other developers through the DFINITY Developer Forum.","title":"Introducing a new approach to handling HTTP requests and serving assets","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"http-middleware","url":"/docs/http-middleware.html","titles":[{"text":"Replacing the bootstrap code: a recap","id":"_replacing_the_bootstrap_code_a_recap"},{"text":"Enabling canisters to respond to HTTP requests","id":"_enabling_canisters_to_respond_to_http_requests"},{"text":"Revisiting the asset storage canister","id":"_revisiting_the_asset_storage_canister"},{"text":"Routing","id":"_routing"},{"text":"Structure of a new DFX project","id":"_structure_of_a_new_dfx_project"},{"text":"Agent and actor creation","id":"_agent_and_actor_creation"},{"text":"Migrating an existing project","id":"_migrating_an_existing_project"},{"text":"Certified and uncertified front-end assets","id":"_certified_and_uncertified_front_end_assets"}]},"/docs/index.html":{"text":"To download the Internet Computer SDK, run the following command in your terminal. sh -ci \"$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)\" By installing the SDK, you agree to our Terms & Conditions.

The Motoko programming language is a high-level, general purpose language that is similar to other modern programming languages, but specifically designed to handle asynchronous messaging efficiently. Although Motoko provides an interpreter that can be used interactively and a standalone compiler, you can write programs and compile your code without using either one directly. Instead, in most cases, you interact with the programming language indirectly through an editor of your choice and using the dfx command-line execution tool. To help you get started using this new language, this section provides a brief overview of the language and describes a few basic conventions for writing programs using Motoko. For more complete information about programming in Motoko, including specific language features and detailed examples, see the Language Reference Guide. As you start to explore the Motoko programming language, you should keep in mind that each application consists of an actor that communicates with other actors by passing messages asynchronously. An actor is a special kind of object that passes its messages in an isolated state. When you define an actor, its messages are processed in sequence but in isolation from on each other. As an example of using actors, consider the following program: let result1 = await service1.computeAnswer(params); let result2 = await service2.computeAnswer(params); finalStep(result1, result2) In this example, the program makes two requests to two distinct services. Each service is implemented internally as an actor (object). The program waits using the await keyword to wait for each result value in sequence. The program then uses the result from each request them in the final step, calling the function finalStep. The actor-based programming model is particularly well-suited for writing programs intended to run on the 互联网计算机平台. However, you can also write programs in Motoko to run on other platforms and inside of other frameworks. If you are writing programs to run on other platforms, you might not use actor objects or asynchronous messaging at all. To support multiple languages and cross-language communication, the Motoko compiler automates the production and consumption of interface descriptions. The Motoko compiler generates the interface descriptions using the type signatures in your Motoko programs and the structure of imported pre-defined interfaces. Like other languages, Motoko includes many common functions in predefined prelude and standard library files that you can import into your programs. By importing the prelude or standard library, you can use common functions like println without explicitly defining them in your programs. For example, you might include a line similar to the following to import list functions from the standard library: import List \"../../motoko/base/list\"; This section describes the basic language conventions you need to know for programming in Motoko. You can use single-line, multi-line, or nested multi-line comments to include descriptive non-executable text in your code. For example, use comments to add context about a code block as a note to yourself or as information you want to share with anyone reviewing or maintaining your code. Properly-formatted comments are treated as whitespace and ignored by the compiler. Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//) and consist of the characters following // to the end of the same line. For example, you can have single-line comments above, below, or on the same line as the code to which the comment applies. // This is a single-line comment on its own line above relevant code import List = \"ListLib\"; You can also include single-line, multi-line, and nested multi-line comments by starting with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and ending with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/). For example: /* This is a comment that is split into multiple lines. */ You can also write nested multi-line comments by starting a multi-line comment block, then starting a second multi-line comment within the first block. For example: /* This is the start of the first multi-line comment block. /* This is the second, nested multi-line comment. */ This is the end of the first multi-line comment block. */ Each Motoko program consists of zero or more declarations, followed by an optional expression. For example, the following snippet consists of two declarations for the variables x and y followed by an expression, forming a single program: let x = 1; let y = x + 1; x * y + x; As illustrated in this example, you use a semi-colon (;) to terminate declarations and expressions. For example, to evaluate a simple equation: 1 + 3; // When executed, the result would be \"4 : Nat\" value and type Motoko supports the following number types: Natural numbers (Nat) are positive whole integers. Integer numbers (Int) are positive, negative, or zero whole number values. Floating point numbers (Float) are fractional numeric 32-bit or 64-bit values. Basic arithmetic operators work as you would expect. For example: 1 + 1; // = 2 0.1 + 0.2; // = 0.3 8 - 1; // = 7 10 * 2; // = 20 35 / 5; // = 7 You can use double (\") quotes to enclose text. For example: let name = \"Chris\"; // let name : Text = \"Chris\" You can use the following relational operators in Motoko programs. Use this To define this relationship ␣␣ Greater than. The operator must be enclosed in whitespace. == Equals. != Not equals. = Greater than or equal to. Use this For this operation + Addition. - Subtraction. * Multiplication. / Division. % Modulo. ** Exponentiation. Use this For this operation & Bitwise AND. | Bitwise OR. ^ Exclusive OR. > Shift right. The operator must be preceded by whitespace. Rotate left. <>> Rotate right. Use this For this operation # Text concatenation. Use this For this operation := Assignment using an in-place update. += In place addition. -= In place subtraction. *= In place multiplication. /= In place divide. %= In place modulo. **= In place exponentiation. &= In place logical AND. |= In place logical OR. ^= In place exclusive OR. >= In place shift right. = In place rotate left. <>>= In place rotate right. #= In place concatenation. Variables enable you to relate static names and types with dynamic values that are present only when a program is executed. You can declare variable names, and if necessary the data type, using the let keyword. For example, you can use the following notation to set the variable x to the natural number 1: let x : Nat = 1; In this example, the compiler can infer that the expression 1 has type Nat, and that x has the same type. Therefore, you can use the following annotation without changing the meaning of the program: let x = 1 Motoko supports the following primitive types: Booleans (true, false) Integers (…​,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …​) Natural numbers (0, 1, 2, …​) Words (fixed-width numbers) Characters (Unicode code points) Text values (strings of Unicode characters) Integers and natural numbers do not silently over- or under-flow. Instead, they use representations that grow to accommodate any finite number. There are also fixed-width integers and natural numbers (in 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit) types that trap on arithmetic over- and under-flow. The fixed-width integers are signed. The fixed-width natural numbers are unsigned. Word values have fixed width. Arithmetic for Word types is performed using modulo 2**N where N is the width of the word type in bits. Motoko does not allow unchecked, uncaught overflows. All primitive types are shareable so that they can be sent and received across remote function calls. Building on the primitive values and types above, the language permits user-defined types, and each of the following non-primitive value forms and associated types: Tuples, including the unit value (the “empty tuple”). Arrays, in both immutable and mutable forms. Objects, with named, unordered fields and methods. Variants, with named constructors and optional payload values. Function values, including shareable functions that can be called remotely. Async values, otherwise known as futures or promises, that can be synchronized with using await. Optional values, that can either be null or of the form ? v, for a proper value v. Note that if your function is returning an optional value of type T, then the function’s return type should be of the form '? T': prefixing a type with question mark (?) adds the null value. For example, you would use the following syntax to indicate that the return value of the type identified by ?Phone is optional (for example, the return value can be null as well as a proper phone number): public query func lookup(name: Name): async ?Phone { return A.find(book, name, nameEq); }; First-class functions support multiple arguments and returns and can be polymorphic. T -> U (T, U) -> (V, W) (x : T, y : U) -> V (x : T, y : U) -> (V, W) Functions can be defined as public or private, shared, or locally-scoped. Objects are structural record types with fields that can be mutable or immutable. Objects with immutable fields are shareable. {var x : Int; color : Color} {x : Int; color: Color} Actors are restricted objects with the following characteristics: State must be isolated. Public methods are implicitly shared. All interactions are asynchronous. Actor objects are marked as actor with syntax similar to the following: actor { private var c = 0; public func inc() { c += 1 }; public func get() : async Int { c } } The fields of an actor are functions that return either: An empty unit return type () which is similar to a void return value. An async return type, which is essentially a promise to return a future value. You can define immutable or mutable arrays. The assignment syntax you use is the same for both immutable and mutable arrays, but you cannot change immutable arrays after allocation. The following is an example of a simple, immutable array that holds three natural numbers, and has the type [Nat]: let test_array : [Nat] = [1, 2, 3] ; In general, an immutable array uses square brackets around the type of the array’s elements, which must share a single common type. Because immutable arrays cannot be modified,immutable arrays are safe to send and share. Unlike immutable arrays, each mutable array in Motoko introduces a private actor state which can be used locally but cannot be used in cases where immutable arrays are expected. Mutable arrays cannot be shared or sent in messages. For more information about working with arrays, see the Motoko Language Reference. A tuple is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements. The number of element in the sequence is fixed, but the elements can consist of different data types. Tuples are often used when you want to have a data structure for an object with specific properties, but you don’t want to create a separate type for it. The following example defines a tuple for a three-dimensional point using integers to specify locations to represent the point on the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis and a color. type Point3D = (Int, Int, Int, Color); let origin = (0, 0, 0, Color.Red); let (x, y, z, _) = origin; func isOrigin(p : Point3D) : Bool { switch p { case (0, 0, 0, _) true; // pattern match case _ false; } } Motoko supports all the common constructs for expressing conditions and switching between cases. For example, you can write if and if else conditions with syntax similar to the following: if ... if ... else ... You can also use switch and case syntax similar to the following: switch { case 1 ...; case 2 ...; case 3 ...} while (p()) ... loop ... loop ... while (p()) for (x in f()) ... Labels help ensure control flow is structured and can be used with the break and continue keywords. label l exp break l (more generally, break l exp) continue l Identifiers are alphanumeric. They must start with an uppercase or lowercase letter and can include a combination of uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The following keywords are reserved for specific purposes and cannot be used as identifiers or for any other purpose in Motoko code: This keyword Is reserved for this purpose actor Declare actor identifiers, actor objects and actor classes. and Boolean conjunction (short-circuiting). async Declare an asynchronous function or create a future. assert Assert a Boolean property (trapping when false). await Await the result of an asynchronous computation. break Exit from a labelled expression or loop (possibly with a value). case Case of a preceding switch expression, consisting of a pattern and expression. catch Failure branch of a preceding try expression. class Class declaration (actor, object and module classes). continue Continue with the next iteration of loop or while or for. debug Conditional debug expressions, excluded from release code. debug_show Display a debug message. else False branch of a conditional expression. false Boolean literal value false. for Iterate over the items of an iterator. func Declare a name function or anonymous function value. if Branch on a Boolean value. ignore Discard the value of an expression. import Import a source file or other resource as a named module. in Indicate the domain of for loop. module Declare a module identifier or module expression. not Negate a Boolean value. null The literal value of type Null. object Declare an object identifier or object expression. or Boolean disjunction (short-circuiting). label Label an expression for early exit via break. let Bind an identifier (or pattern) to a value. loop Enter a loop (possibly with a guarded exit). private Restrict the visibility of a declaration to the enclosing actor, object, module or class. public Publish a declaration as member(s) of the enclosing actor, object, module or class. query A modifier on shared functions that return results without modifying state. return Exit from a function or async block (possibly with a value). shared Declare a function that can be called remotely. switch Conditional pattern matching, defined by cases. throw Exit from an expression with an error. true A Boolean value returned as the result of a comparison. try Declare a scoped error handler. type Declare a type abbreviation. var Specify a (mutable) variable, field or array that can be updated. while Enter a guarded loop.","title":"Learning the basics of Motoko","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"basic-syntax-rules","url":"/docs/developers-guide/basic-syntax-rules.html","titles":[{"text":"Actors and asynchronous messaging","id":"_actors_and_asynchronous_messaging"},{"text":"Interface descriptions and Motoko","id":"_interface_descriptions_and_motoko"},{"text":"Prelude and standard library functions","id":"_prelude_and_standard_library_functions"},{"text":"Basic language features","id":"_basic_language_features"},{"text":"Comments","id":"_comments"},{"text":"Single-line comments","id":"_single_line_comments"},{"text":"Multi-line and nested comments","id":"_multi_line_and_nested_comments"},{"text":"Programs, declarations, and expressions","id":"_programs_declarations_and_expressions"},{"text":"Numbers, text and operators","id":"_numbers_text_and_operators"},{"text":"Relational operators","id":"_relational_operators"},{"text":"Numeric binary operators","id":"_numeric_binary_operators"},{"text":"Bitwise binary operators","id":"_bitwise_binary_operators"},{"text":"String operators","id":"_string_operators"},{"text":"Assignment operators","id":"_assignment_operators"},{"text":"Variables","id":"_variables"},{"text":"Primitive values","id":"_primitive_values"},{"text":"Non-primitive values","id":"_non_primitive_values"},{"text":"Functions","id":"_functions"},{"text":"Objects and actors","id":"_objects_and_actors"},{"text":"Arrays","id":"_arrays"},{"text":"Tuples","id":"_tuples"},{"text":"Conditional and switching","id":"_conditional_and_switching"},{"text":"While, Loops, and iteration","id":"_while_loops_and_iteration"},{"text":"Label, break, and continue","id":"_label_break_and_continue"},{"text":"Identifiers","id":"_identifiers"},{"text":"Reserved keywords","id":"_reserved_keywords"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/cli-reference.html":{"text":"The DFINITY command-line execution environment (dfx) is the primary tool for creating, deploying, and managing the dapps for the 互联网计算机平台.

Cycles are generated from the conversion of Internet Computer (ICP) utility tokens. The 互联网计算机 is a decentralized public utility, controlled by the NNS –– the network’s open, algorithmic governance system. The NNS fundamentally controls how many cycles are required for low-level computation actions for computation and storage. The number of cycles needed for individual computations will vary based on a number of factors considered by the NNS, including proposals from the community. Canister smart contract computations running on the Internet Computer blockchain are fueled by “cycles”, which play a similar role to “gas” on Ethereum. There are several major differences however. One of the most fundamental differences is that Ethereum leverages “user pays” and the Internet Computer and “smart contract pays” (sometimes called “reverse gas”) model. Whereas the Ethereum blockchain requires end users to send payments for the gas smart contracts consume with every transaction, on the Internet Computer, Canister smart contracts are pre-charged with cycles, such that contracts effectively pay for their own computation - freeing users from the responsibility.

Cycles reflect the operational cost of communication, computation, and storage that dapps consume. Unlike ICP tokens, cycles are only associated with canisters and not user or developer principals. Because only canisters require and consume cycles—to perform operations and to pay for the resources they use—users and developers manage the distribution and ownership of cycles through a special type of canister called a cycles wallet. Because the cycles wallet holds the cycles required to perform operations such as creating new canisters, these operations are executed using the canister principal for the cycles wallet instead of your user principal. For the purposes of using the local canister execution environment, the DFINITY Canister SDK automatically creates a default cycles wallet for you in every project and most of the operations performed using the cycles wallet happen behind the scenes. For example, the cycles wallet acts on your behalf to register canister principals and deploy canisters in the local canister execution environment. In a production environment, however, you need to explicitly register and transfer cycles to new canisters, specify the principals that can act as custodians, and manage the principals with ownership rights. You can perform some of these tasks using the default cycles wallet dapp running in a web browser. Depending on the specific action you want to take, you can also perform these cycle and canister management tasks by running dfx wallet commands in a terminal or by calling methods in the default cycles wallet canister directly. You should keep in mind, however, that calls to the cycles wallet canister are executed using the cycles wallet principal associated with the currently-selected user identity. Depending on your currently-selected identity and whether the principal associated with that identity has been added as a controller or a custodian for a wallet, you might see different results or be denied access to a specific method. To check the identity you are currently using, run the following command: dfx identity whoami A user principal or canister principal can be assigned to a controller or custodian role. A controller is the most privileged role and a principal assigned to the controller role can perform privileged tasks including the following: Add and remove other principals as controllers. Authorize and de-authorize other principals as custodians. Add entries to the cycles wallet address book. Access the cycles wallet balance and all other wallet-related information. Send cycles to other canisters. Accept receipt of cycles from other canisters. Rename the cycles wallet. Create canisters and additional cycles wallets. A principal assigned to the custodian role can only perform a subset of cycles wallet management tasks, including the following: Access the cycles wallet balance and all other wallet-related information. Send cycles to other canisters. Accept receipt of cycles from other canisters. Create canisters. Authorizing a principal as a custodian does not automatically grant the principal access to a cycles wallet. The identity assigned to the custodian role must also be assigned a cycles wallet principal. For example, if you authorize the identity alice_custodian as a custodian of a cycles wallet (rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai) in a local project, that user would also need to be assigned to use that wallet with the dfx identity set-wallet rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai command. If you are doing local development, your cycles wallet is created when you register a new canister principal using dfx canister create or when you register, build, and deploy a canister with dfx deploy. If you are deploying on the 互联网计算机, you typically create your cycles wallet by converting ICP tokens to cycles, transferring the cycles to a new canister principal, and updating the canister with the default cycles wallet WebAssembly module (WASM). There are dapps that can help you convert ICP to cycles and create a new cycles wallet, e.g., NNS dapp. In the local canister execution environment or with a cycles wallet on the 互联网计算机, you can use the dfx wallet balance command or the wallet_balance method to check the current cycle balance. If you are doing local development, you can use the dfx wallet balance command to check the current cycles balance on a project-by-project basis. To check the cycles balance in a local project: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start --background Display the cycles balance from the cycles wallet associated with the currently-selected identity by running the following command: dfx wallet balance The command displays output similar to the following: 78000000000000 cycles. If you have deployed a cycles wallet on the 互联网计算机, you can use the dfx wallet balance command to check the current cycles balance on the network. To check the cycles balance on the 互联网计算机: Open a terminal and navigate to a directory that contains a dfx.json configuration file. Check your connection to the 互联网计算机 by running the following command: dfx ping ic Display the cycle balance from the cycles wallet associated with the currently-selected identity by running the following command: dfx wallet --network ic balance The command displays output similar to the following: 67991783875995 cycles. You can also check the cycles balance by calling the wallet_balance method in the cycles wallet canister directly. For example, if your principal is a controller for the h5aet-waaaa-aaaab-qaamq-cai cycles wallet, you can check the current cycle balance by running the following command: dfx canister --network ic call h5aet-waaaa-aaaab-qaamq-cai wallet_balance The command returns the balance using Candid format as a record with an amount field (represented by the hash 3_573_748_184) and a balance of 6,895,656,625,450 cycles like this: (record { 3_573_748_184 = 6_895_656_625_450 }) If you are the controller of a cycles wallet, you can add other user principals or canister principals to the controller role. Adding a principal to the controller role also automatically adds the principal to the custodian role. To add a controller to a cycles wallet in a the local project: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start --background Display the cycles balance from the cycles wallet associated with the currently-selected identity by running a command similar to the following: dfx wallet add-controller For example, you would run the following command to add the user represented by the principal b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe as a controller of the local cycles wallet: dfx wallet add-controller b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe The command displays output similar to the following: Added b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe as a controller. You can use the dfx wallet controllers command or the get_controllers method to list the principals that have full control over a specified cycles wallet canister. To list the controllers for a cycles wallet in a local project: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start --background List the principals that have full control over the cycles wallet in the current project by running the following command: dfx wallet controllers The command displays the textual representation of the principals that have control over the cycles wallet with output similar to the following: tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe You can use the dfx wallet remove-controller command or the remove_controller method to remove a principal as a controller. To remove a controller for a cycles wallet in a local project: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start --background Specify the principal to remove from the controller role in the current project by running a command similar to the following: dfx wallet remove-controller b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe The command output similar to the following: Removed b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe as a controller. You can use the dfx wallet authorize command or the authorize method to authorize a principal as a custodian of a cycles wallet. To authorize a principal as a custodian for the cycles wallet in a local project: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start --background Specify the principal to authorize as a custodian in the current project and for the current identity by running a command similar to the following: dfx wallet authorize b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe The command output similar to the following: Authorized b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe as a custodian. You can use the dfx wallet custodians command or the get_custodians method to return the list of principals that are currently defined as custodians for the cycles wallet. To list the custodians for a cycles wallet in a local project: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start --background List the principals that have the custodian role for the cycles wallet in the current project by running the following command: dfx wallet custodians The command displays output similar to the following: tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe You can use the dfx wallet deauthorize command or the deauthorize method to remove a principal as a custodian for a cycles wallet. De-authorizing a principal that was previously added as a controller also automatically removes the principal from the controller role. To remove a custodian for a cycles wallet in a local project: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start --background Specify the principal to remove from the custodian role in the current project by running a command similar to the following: dfx wallet deauthorize b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe The command output similar to the following: Deauthorized b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe as a custodian. You can use dfx wallet send command of the wallet_send method to send a specific number of cycles to a specific canister. Keep in mind that the canister you specify must be a cycles wallet or have a wallet_receive method to accept the cycles. If you have deployed a cycles wallet on the 互联网计算机, you can use the dfx wallet send command to send cycles between canisters. To send cycles to another canister running on the 互联网计算机: Open a terminal and navigate to a directory that contains a dfx.json configuration file. Check your connection to the 互联网计算机 by running the following command: dfx ping ic Get the principal for the canister that you want to receive the cycles. For example, run the following command to display the cycles wallet principal associated with the current user identity on the 互联网计算机: dfx identity --network ic get-wallet The command displays the cycles wallet principal with output similar to the following: gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai Send cycles to the canister by running a command similar to the following: dfx wallet --network ic send For example: dfx wallet --network ic send gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai 10000000000 If the transfer is successful, the command does not displays any output. The maximum number of cycles that can be stored in a cycles wallet is 2128. Check the cycles wallet balance to see the updated number of cycles available by running the following command: dfx wallet --network ic balance For example: 67991699387090 cycles. You can use the dfx wallet addresses command or the list_addresses method to list the principals and roles that have been configured for the cycles wallet. To view address book entries for a cycles wallet running on the 互联网计算机: Open a terminal and navigate to a directory that contains a dfx.json configuration file. Check your connection to the 互联网计算机 by running the following command: dfx ping ic Get the address book entries for the cycles wallet by running the following command : dfx wallet --network ic addresses The command displays the controllers and custodians for the cycles wallet with output similar to the following: Id: tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe, Kind: Unknown, Role: Controller, Name: No name set. Id: ejta3-neil3-qek6c-i7rdw-sxreh-lypfe-v6hjg-6so7x-5ugze-3iohr-2qe, Kind: Unknown, Role: Custodian, Name: No name set. Id: b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe, Kind: Unknown, Role: Controller, Name: No name set. The default cycles wallet canister includes additional methods that are not exposed as dfx wallet commands. The additional methods support more advanced cycles management tasks such as creating new canisters and managing events. Use the wallet_create_wallet method to create a new cycles wallet canister with an initial cycle balance and, optionally, with a specific principal as its controller. If you don’t specify a controlling principal, the cycles wallet you use to create the new wallet will be the new wallet’s controller. For example, you can run a command similar to the following to create a new wallet and assign a principal as a controller: dfx canister --network call f3yw6-7qaaa-aaaab-qaabq-cai wallet_create_wallet '(record { cycles = 5000000000000 : nat64; controller = principal \"vpqee-nujda-46rtu-4noo7-qnxmb-zqs7g-5gvqf-4gy7t-vuprx-u2urx-gqe\"})' The command returns the principal for the new wallet: (record { 1_313_628_723 = principal \"dcxxq-jqaaa-aaaab-qaavq-cai\" }) Use the wallet_create_canister method to register a new canister principal on the 互联网计算机. This method creates a new \"empty\" canister placeholder with an initial cycle balance and, optionally, with a specific principal as its controller. After you have registered the canister principal, you can install code for your canister as a separate step. For example, you can run a command similar to the following to create a new wallet and assign a principal as a controller: dfx canister --network call f3yw6-7qaaa-aaaab-qaabq-cai wallet_create_canister '(record { cycles = 5000000000000 : nat64; controller = principal \"vpqee-nujda-46rtu-4noo7-qnxmb-zqs7g-5gvqf-4gy7t-vuprx-u2urx-gqe\"})' The command returns the principal for the new canister you created: (record { 1_313_628_723 = principal \"dxqg5-iyaaa-aaaab-qaawa-cai\" }) Use the wallet_receive method as an endpoint to receive cycles. Use the wallet_call method to forward calls using the cycles wallet principal as caller.

Canister smart contract Canister smart contracts, sometimes also simply called canisters, are an extended form of smart contracts. They are revolutionary because they can be run in parallel deterministically. This is enabled by relying on the actor model and deterministic message passing. A canister smart contract has a universally-unique identifier and an owner that defines the boundaries of a specific dapp. A canister encapsulates all of the programming logic, public entry methods, the interface description for the provided message types, and state information for the dapp it describes. principal A principal is an entity that can be authenticated by the 互联网计算机 blockchain. Principals that interact with the 互联网计算机 blockchain often do so via an identity. For example, the first time you use the DFINITY Canister SDK, the dfx command-line tool creates a default developer identity for you with a public/private key pair in a PEM file. This developer identity determines a principal. There is a textual representation of the principal which is often referred to as your principal identifier. Note that the developer identity can also be used to derive an account identifier—similar to a Bitcoin or Ethereum address—to hold ICP tokens on the identity’s behalf in the ledger canister. controller A controller is a principal that has special rights to manage the canister smart contract it controls. For example, only a controlling principal can be used to install, upgrade, or delete the canister under its control. You can specify the controller principal using the textual representation of a principal—often referred to as the principal identifier—associated with a user or with a canister. ledger The 互联网计算机 blockchain records all transactions involving ICP tokens in a specialized management canister smart contract, called the ledger canister. The ledger canister implements a smart contract that maintains accounts and balances and keeps a history of the transactions that affect accounts and balances. The transactions are recorded to track the following specific events: Mint ICP tokens for accounts. Transfer ICP tokens from one account to another. Burn ICP tokens to eliminate them from existence. wallet A wallet is a specialized dapp (implemented as a canister smart contract) that allows to store and manage cycles. Cycles are used to pay for computation and resource consumption on the 互联网计算机 blockchain. Cycles can be obtained by conversion from the 互联网计算机 blockchain’s native utility token ICP. node A physical or virtual machine that hosts all the hardware, replica software, and configuration settings required to participate in the 互联网计算机 blockchain. replica In the context of the 互联网计算机 blockchain, a replica refers to the 互联网计算机 protocol processes running on a node. WebAssembly WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level computer instruction format. Because WebAssembly defines a portable, open-standard, binary format that abstracts cleanly over most modern computer hardware, it is broadly supported for programs that run on the internet.

Using the Language Server Protocol, a language server enables standardized inter-process communication between a programming language and any editor, integrated development environment (IDE), or client endpoint tool. Because the Language Server Protocol (LSP) standardizes the protocol for how language-specific servers and development tools communicate, a single language server can be re-used in multiple development tools with minimal effort. With the DFINITY Canister SDK, you can add a language server for Motoko to your editor or development environment client by invoking the dfx _language-service programmatically when you open Motoko programs in an editor or development environment configured to recognize the language server. You can use any editor or integrated development environment that supports the Language Server Protocol to invoke the dfx _language-service programmatically. Once invoked, the language server ensures that your development environment reports Motoko compiler errors and provides code completion and refactoring tools. For example, if you use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or Emacs as your development environment, you can install a plugin extension that enables those editors to automatically invoke the Motoko language server. Only the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) plugin extension is currently available for Motoko. For information about installing the plugin, see Install the language editor plug-in. Although it is extremely rare that you would start the Motoko language server directly in a terminal shell. it is possible to do so by running the following command: dfx _language-service --force-tty Note that you can only run this command from within a project directory. For example, if your project name is hello_world, your current working directory must be the hello_world top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories. dfx _language-service [canister_name] [flag] You can use the following optional flags with the dfx _language-service command. Flag Description --force-tty Starts the the Motoko language server directly in a terminal shell. -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. You can specify the following arguments for the dfx _language-service command. Argument Description canister_name Specifies the name of the canister that the compiler should monitor. If you specify a canister name, the name should match a canister name you have configured in the dfx.json configuration file for your project. If you don’t specify a canister name, the first canister specified in the dfx.json configuration file is used as the target. If you want to use an integrated development environment to develop code for the canister my-canister you should have the development environment invoke the language service using the following dfx _language-service command: dfx _language-service my-canister","title":"Language server and development client support","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"lang-service-ide","url":"/docs/developers-guide/lang-service-ide.html","titles":[{"text":"Adding a language server for Motoko","id":"_adding_a_language_server_for_motoko"},{"text":"Invoking the language service manually","id":"_invoking_the_language_service_manually"},{"text":"Basic usage","id":"_basic_usage"},{"text":"Flags","id":"_flags"},{"text":"Arguments","id":"_arguments"},{"text":"Examples","id":"_examples"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/sample-apps.html":{"text":"Sample code, applications, and microservices that have been developed by DFINITY or contributed by the community are available from the DFINITY public repository.

The 互联网计算机 is a blockchain that runs canister smart contracts, which are code units bundling together WebAssembly bytecode and the memory pages the bytecode runs in. The 互联网计算机 is composed of individual subnet blockchains running in parallel and connected together by the use of Chain Key cryptography. This means that canisters running on a subnet can seamlessly call canisters hosted in any other subnet of the 互联网计算机 blockchain. Moreover, the governance system of the 互联网计算机 can dynamically increase the capacity of the 互联网计算机 by adding new subnets, allowing dapps to scale out. Developers can thus build new dapps consisting of multiple canisters running in parallel on different subnets and possibly integrate them with existing canisters already running on the 互联网计算机. At a high-level, there are two main possible workflows for developing dapps that run on the 互联网计算机 blockchain. Local development: you start a local canister execution environment simulating the 互联网计算机 blockchain on your computer. Then you write, compile, install and iteratively update your canisters in the local execution environment. This gives you the possibility to test your canisters locally without the need to use cycles to power them. On-chain deployment: once your dapp is ready you can then deploy it to the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet, making it available for the world to use it. Note that your canisters need to have cycles to be able to run on the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet, as discussed in Tokens and cycles. Regardless of the development workflow you choose, keep in mind that when you deploy a canister for the first time, either on a local execution environment or on the 互联网计算机, a unique principal identifier is created for your canister smart contract. For example, if you start developing your canister locally and then deploy it to the 互联网计算机, then your canister will generally have a different identifier on the local execution environment and on the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet. Note that it is also possible for you to register a principal identifier for your new canister before deploying it or even writing any line of code.","title":"互联网计算机 SDK - Developer Tools","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"sdk-guide","url":"/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html","titles":[{"text":"Developing dapps","id":"_developing_dapps"},{"text":"Developer workflow at-a-glance","id":"_developer_workflow_at_a_glance"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/troubleshooting.html":{"text":"This section provides information to help you troubleshoot and resolve or work around common issues that are related to the following tasks: downloading and installing the DFINITY Canister SDK creating, building, or deploying canisters using the dfx command-line interface running the local canister execution environment 因为项目依赖webpack为默认前端提供框架，所以你的开发环境中必须安装`node.js`，并且在项目目录下可以访问。 如果你想在不使用默认 webpack 配置和 canister别名的情况下开发你的项目，你可以从 dfx.json 文件中删除 assets canister或使用特定的 canister名称构建你的项目。 例如，您可以通过运行以下命令来选择仅构建 hello 程序，而无需前端资源： dfx build hello 如果你使用默认的 webpack 配置并且运行 dfx build 失败，你应该尝试在项目目录中运行 npm install 然后重新运行 dfx build。 如果在项目目录下运行 npm install 没有解决问题，你应该检查 webpack.config.js 文件的配置是否有语法错误。 Currently, there is no automatic migration or backward compatibility for any projects that you might have created using previous versions of the dfx command-line interface. After upgrading to the latest version, you might see error or failure messages if you attempt to build or install a project created with a previous version of the dfx command-line interface. In many cases, however, you can continue to work with projects from a previous release by manually changing the dfx setting in the dfx.json configuration file, then rebuilding the project to be compatible with the version of the dfx command-line interface you have currently installed. For example, if you have a project that was created with dfx version 0.8.0, open the dfx.json file in a text editor and change the dfx setting to the latest version or remove the section entirely. In some cases, starting the local canister execution environment fails due to stale state. If you encounter issues when running dfx start to start the local canister execution environment: In the terminal that displays the IC emulation the execution environment uses, press Control-C to interrupt the local canister execution environment process. Stop the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx stop Restart the local canister execution environment in a clean state by running the following command: dfx start --clean The --clean option removes checkpoints and stale state information from your project’s cache so that you can restart the local canister execution environment and web server processes in a clean state. Keep in mind, however, that if you reset the state information by running dfx start --clean, your existing canisters are also removed. After running dfx start --clean, recreate your canisters by running the following commands: dfx canister create --all dfx build dfx canister install --all If you run into problems building or deploying canisters after successfully connecting to the 互联网计算机 and registering canister identifiers, you should remove the canisters directory before attempting to rebuild or redeploy the canisters. You can remove the canisters directory for a project by running the following command in the project’s root directory: rm -rf ./.dfx/* canisters/* Many of the bugs you might encounter can be addressed by uninstalling and reinstalling the dfx command-line interface. Here are a few ways to reinstall dfx. If you only have one version of dfx installed in your development environment, you can usually run the following command to uninstall and reinstall the latest version of dfx: ~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci \"$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)\" If you have modified the location of the dfx binary, you might want run the following command to uninstall the version of dfx that is in your PATH, then reinstall the latest version of dfx: rm -rf ~/.cache/dfinity && rm $(which dfx) && sh -ci \"$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)\" Some versions of the DFINITY Canister SDK prompted you to install Xcode when creating a new project on a macOS computer. The prompt has been removed and the dfx new command does not require you to install any macOS developer tools. However, you should have Developer Command Line Tools installed if you want to create a Git repository for your project. You can check whether you have the developer tools installed by running xcode-select -p. You can install the developer tools by running xcode-select --install. If you are running dfx using a virtual machine image on Ubuntu or CentOS, you might see an error message that looks like this when you attempt to run the dfx build command: Building hello... An error occurred: Io( Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\", }, ) If you are developing projects locally, you often have the local canister execution environment running either in a separate terminal or in the background. If the local environment processes do not get properly terminated, you might see operating system errors indicating that an address is already in use or or be unable to stop processes normally using the dfx stop command. There are several scenarios in which you might encounter this issue. For example, if you run dfx start in a local project directory then change to a different local project directory without first stopping the canister execution environment processes, you might see this issue. If you encounter an issue where you suspect or you receive a message that an address is already in use or that a process is already running in the background, perform the following steps: Run the following command to see which process is listening to the 8000 port if you are using the default binding to localhost: lsof -i tcp:8000 Run the following command to terminate any orphan processes: killall dfx replica Close the current terminal and open a new terminal window. In the new terminal, run the following command to run the local canister execution environment in a clean state: dfx start --clean --background Fixing memory leaks is an ongoing process. If you encounter any error messages related to memory leaks, you should do the following: Run dfx stop to stop currently running processes. Uninstall dfx to prevent further degradation. Re-install dfx Run dfx start to restart replica processes. Alternatively, you can remove the .cache/dfinity directory and re-install the latest dfx binary. For example: rm -rf ~/.cache/dfinity && sh -ci \"$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)\"","title":"Troubleshoot issues","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"troubleshooting","url":"/docs/developers-guide/troubleshooting.html","titles":[{"text":"确保 node 在项目中可用","id":"troubleshoot-node"},{"text":"Migrating an existing project","id":"_migrating_an_existing_project"},{"text":"Restarting the local canister execution environment","id":"_restarting_the_local_canister_execution_environment"},{"text":"Removing the canisters directory","id":"_removing_the_canisters_directory"},{"text":"Reinstalling dfx","id":"_reinstalling_dfx"},{"text":"Xcode prerequisite","id":"_xcode_prerequisite"},{"text":"Failed build when using VMs","id":"_failed_build_when_using_vms"},{"text":"Address in use error or orphan processes","id":"_address_in_use_error_or_orphan_processes"},{"text":"Memory leak","id":"_memory_leak"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials-intro.html":{"text":"The Quick start provided a simplified introduction to the basic work flow for creating and deploying a new project without exploring the contents of the project directory or sample code. Next, we’ll explore writing a few simple programs to give you hands-on experience creating programs that run on the 互联网计算机平台. Most of these tutorials illustrate how to write dapps using the Motoko programming language. For additional examples of dapps written in other languages, see the DFINITY examples repository. The following tutorials introduce the basics for writing dapps that run on the 互联网计算机平台: Explore the default project takes a closer look at the work flow for creating projects by exploring the default files and folders that are added to your workspace when you create a new project. Query using an actor highlights how to replace the typical print function usually defined in a \"Hello, World!\" canister by defining an actor (object) with a hello function. Pass text arguments introduces different ways you can pass arguments to a function using the command-line in a terminal shell. Increment a natural number guides you through the process of writing a dapp that creates an actor with functions to increment and return the value of a counter. Use integers in calculator functions shows you how to write a simple calculator dapp for more practice working with Motoko and to learn more about how you can customize your project environment. Import library modules illustrates how to import and use a few basic Motoko base library functions for working with key-value pairs in a list. Use multiple actors describes how to include multiple unrelated actors in a single project to illustrate how you can compile multiple canisters for the same project. Customize the front-end illustrates using a simple React framework to create a new front-end for the default sample canister and guides you through some basic modifications to customize the interface displayed. If you already know how to use CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React or other frameworks to build your user interface, you can skip this tutorial. Add a stylesheet illustrates how to add a stylesheet when you use React to create a new front-end for your project. If you already know how to add stylesheets to React, you can skip this tutorial. Make inter-canister calls illustrates how to make simple calls to functions defined in one canister from another canister in the same project.

Continuing production\"); } function initCanisterIds() { try { prodCanisters = require(path.resolve(\"canister_ids.json\")); } catch (error) { console.log(\"No production canister_ids.json found. Continuing with local\"); } const network = process.env.DFX_NETWORK || (process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\" ? \"ic\" : \"local\"); canisters = network === \"local\" ? localCanisters : prodCanisters; for (const canister in canisters) { process.env[canister.toUpperCase() + \"_CANISTER_ID\"] = canisters[canister][network]; } } initCanisterIds(); 在很多情况下，您可以原样使用默认的`webpack.config.js` 文件，无需任何修改，也可以添加插件、模块和其他自定义配置以满足您的需求。 您对 webpack.config.js 配置所做的具体更改很大程度上取决于您要使用的其他工具和框架。 例如，如果您尝试过链接：Customize the front-end 或 Add a stylesheet 前端教程，您可能有 修改了以下部分以使用 React JavaScript： module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(ts|tsx|jsx)$/, loader: \"ts-loader\" }, { test: /\\.css$/, use: ['style-loader','css-loader'] } ] } }; } 如果您的应用程序不使用 dfx 来运行您的构建脚本，您可以自己提供变量。 例如： DFX_NETWORK=staging NODE_ENV=production HELLO_CANISTER_ID=rrkah... npm run build 因为项目依赖webpack为默认前端提供框架，所以你的开发环境中必须安装`node.js`，并且在项目目录下可以访问。 如果你想在不使用默认 webpack 配置和 canister别名的情况下开发你的项目，你可以从 dfx.json 文件中删除 assets canister或使用特定的 canister名称构建你的项目。 例如，您可以通过运行以下命令来选择仅构建 hello 程序，而无需前端资源： dfx build hello 如果你使用默认的 webpack 配置并且运行 dfx build 失败，你应该尝试在项目目录中运行 npm install 然后重新运行 dfx build。 如果在项目目录下运行 npm install 没有解决问题，你应该检查 webpack.config.js 文件的配置是否有语法错误。 链接中的几个教程和示例项目：https://github.com/dfinity/examples[examples] 存储库说明了如何使用 npm install 命令添加 React 模块。 您可以使用这些模块来构建要在项目中使用的用户界面组件。 例如，您可以运行以下命令来安装 react-router 模块： npm install --save react react-router-dom 然后，您可以使用该模块构建类似于以下内容的导航组件： import React from 'react'; import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'; const Navigation = () => { return ( Remember Watch Listen Read Write ); } export default Navigation; 从 dfx 0.7.7 开始，我们现在在我们的 dfx new 启动器中为您提供 webpack dev-server。 webpack 开发服务器——webpack-dev-server——提供对 webpack 资源的内存访问，使您能够进行更改并使用实时重新加载立即在浏览器中看到它们的反映。 要利用`webpack-dev-server`： 创建一个新项目并切换到您的项目目录。 如有必要，在本地启动 互联网计算机，并像往常一样进行部署，例如，通过运行 dfx deploy 命令。 通过运行以下命令启动 webpack 开发服务器： npm start 打开 Web 浏览器并使用端口 8080 导航到您的应用程序的资产 canister。 例如: http://localhost:8080 打开一个新的终端窗口或选项卡并导航到您的项目目录。 在文本编辑器中打开项目的 index.js 文件并更改内容。 例如，您可以使用 JavaScript 向页面添加一个元素： document.body.onload = addElement; document.body.onload = addElement; function addElement () { // create a new div element const newDiv = document.createElement(\"div\"); // and give it some content const newContent = document.createTextNode(\"Test live page reloading!\"); // add the text node to the newly created div newDiv.appendChild(newContent); // add the newly created element and its content into the DOM const currentDiv = document.getElementById(\"div1\"); document.body.insertBefore(newDiv, currentDiv); } 将更改保存到 index.js 文件，但让编辑器保持打开状态以继续进行更改。 刷新浏览器或等待它自行刷新以查看您的更改。 当您完成项目的前端工作后，您可以按 Control-C 停止 webpack 开发服务器。 你可能想使用 webpack 以外的打包器。 每个捆绑程序的说明还没有准备好，但如果您熟悉捆绑程序，以下步骤应该可以帮助您： 从 package.json 中移除 copy:types、prestart 和 prebuild 脚本 运行 dfx deploy 为您的 canister生成本地绑定 将生成的绑定复制到您希望保留它们的目录中 修改 declarations//index.js 并将 process.env._CANISTER_ID 替换为打包器环境变量的等效模式 如果这是您的首选工作流程，也可以对 canister ID 进行硬编码 提交声明并将它们导入到您的代码库中","title":"前端开发概览","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"webpack-config","url":"/docs/developers-guide/webpack-config.html","titles":[{"text":"如何使用默认模板","id":"_如何使用默认模板"},{"text":"修改 webpack 配置","id":"_修改_webpack_配置"},{"text":"输入输出配置","id":"_输入输出配置"},{"text":"确保 node 在项目中可用","id":"troubleshoot-node"},{"text":"在 React 框架中使用其他模块","id":"_在_react_框架中使用其他模块"},{"text":"使用 webpack-dev-server 更快地迭代","id":"_使用_webpack_dev_server_更快地迭代"},{"text":"使用其他框架","id":"_使用其他框架"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/work-with-languages.html":{"text":"本文档中的大多数示例都使用Motoko（一种专门设计用于Internet Computer的编程语言）。但是，您可以使用可编译为WebAssembly的任何语言编写程序，以部署在Internet Computer上运行的应用程序。 您可以使用Cargo编译程序并使用WebAssembly作为输出来创建一个Rust项目运行在Internet Computer上。 本节总结了在Internet Computer上将Rust程序作为Canister部署时所涉及的关键步骤。然而，您应该知道，此处描述的步骤仅说明了一种方法，其他的实现方式也是可能的。 请注意，Rust Canister开发工具包（Rust CDK） 提供了一些快捷方式，可简化编写查询和更新函数调用的过程，并提供了一些示例来帮助您开始构建基于Rust的项目，但您也可以为Internet Computer开发应用程序而不使用Rust CDK。 因为大部分的Rust程序员使用Cargo来处理创建和包管理任务（储如下载和编译依赖库），首先使用Cargo命令行接口来创建一个新的Rust项目。 或者，您可以使用DFINITY Canister软件开发包(SDK)来代替Cargo创建新的项目，但是使用Cargo来创建新项目代表了Rust项目的典型工作流程。 创建一个新项目： 在本地计算机上打开终端。 运行以下命令以验证Cargo是否安装： cargo --version 更改您的IC或Rust示例项目的目录。 运行类似以下命令来创新项目： cargo new my_rust_dapp 该命令创建一个新的`my_rust_dapp目录，包含了默认的Cargo.toml文件和带有默认main.rs文件的src`目录。 运行以下命令进入到项目录： cd my_rust_dapp 如果您显示该目录内容，您将看到目录下仅包含`Cargo.toml文件和src`目录。为了编译项目以使能在Internet Computer上运行，您还需要一些其他文件。 manifest 文件为每个Rust包提供一个清单。清单包含了包的配置明细。为准备Rust项目运行在Internet Computer上，我们需要拷贝默认的*manifest*文件并修改一些详细配置信息。 修改`Cargo.toml`文件： 如果有必要，运行pwd命令来检查您是否在项目的根目录下。 运行以下命令拷贝默认的`Cargo.toml`文件到src目录： cp Cargo.toml src/Cargo.toml 在Internet Computer上运行的项目通常使用一个项目级别的`Cargo.toml文件为项目的Canister成员设置工作区，并在源代码目录中使用第二个Cargo.toml`文件为每个Canister配置参数。 用文本编辑器打开项目根目录下的`Cargo.toml`文件 默认情况下，该文件包含[package]和[dependencies]部分。 用类似以下`[workspace]部分来替换[package]`： [workspace] members = [ \"src/my_rust_dapp\", ] 有关`[workspace]部分和键值信息，请参阅Workspaces。有关Cargo.toml`配置的其他部分和键值，请参阅清单格式。 删除`[dependencies]` 部分保存并关闭文件 在文本编辑器中打开`src/Cargo.toml` 文件 增加类似以下带有主要源代码目录的`[lib]` [lib] path = \"main.rs\" 更新`[dependencies]`部分的依赖项 保存并关闭文件。 当您用DFINITY Canister SDK创建一个新项目时，+dfx new+`命令自动添加一个默认+dfx.json+`配置文件到项目目录。因为他们已经使用Cargo来创建Rust项目，所以您需要手工在项目目录下创建该文件。 添加`dfx.json`配置文件： 如有必要，用pwd命令来检查您是否仍在项目目录下。 在项目根目录下创建一个dfx.json配置文件。 在文本编辑器中打开dfx.json文件。 添加类似以下设置的version和canisters键到dfx.json文件 { \"version\": 1, \"canisters\": { \"my_rust_dapp\": { \"type\": \"custom\", \"candid\": \"src/my_rust_dapp.did\", \"wasm\": \"target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/my_rust_dapp.wasm\", \"build\": \"cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --package my_rust_dapp\" } } } 让我们详细看看这些配置 `version`用于标识创建项目软件的版本号 `version`部分指定项目的Canister名字。在本例中，仅有一个名为my_rust_program的Canister 因为不是可标识的canister类型之一（motoko或assets），`type`键设置为custom `candid`键指定用于此项目的Candid接口描述文件的名称和位置。 `wasm`键指定cargo编译命令生成的WebAssembly文件路径 `build`键指定用于编译输出的cargo命令 这些是最小配置需要。随着您构建更复杂的程序，您会需要在 Cargo.toml, dfx.json中进行其他详细配置 保存并关闭文件。 除了`dfx.json配置文件之外，您还需要一个Candid接口描述文件（例如，my_rust_dapp.did`），以映射程序输入参数和返回值格式到Candid中伪代码表现形式。 添加Candid接口描述文件： 如有必要，用`pwd`命令来检查您是否仍在项目目录下。 在项目的src目录下创建一个新的Candid接口描述文件（例如`my_rust_dapp.did`） 在文本编辑器中打开这个描述文件并且为程序中每一个函数添加描述。 例如，如果 my_rust_dapp 是一个简单的计数器程序，使用`increment, `+read+`和+write+函数，+my_rust_dapp.did+`看起来是这样的： service : { \"increment\": () -> (); \"read\": () -> (nat) query; \"write\": (nat) -> (); } 保存并关闭文件。 当您创建一个新的项目，+src+`目录包含了一个\"Hello World!\"的模板+main.rs+`文件 修改模板源代码： 在文本编辑器中打开`src/main.rs`文件并删除存在的内容。 编写您想在 互联网计算机 上发布的程序。 编写程序时，请注意有两种类型的调用（更新调用和查询调用），更新函数使用异步消息 保存并关闭 src/main.rs文件。 在您部署和测试程序之前，您有以下工作要做： 连接您开发环境Internet Computer网络本地运行或连接到您能访问的子网上远程运行。 为您的应用注册一个网络特定标识符。 编译带有WebAssembly输出目标的程序。 因为您使用编译成WebAssembly的 cargo build 命令配置了自定义 dfx.json 文件，所以可以使用dfx命令行接口和标准工作流程来执行所有其余步骤。 本地生成和部署： 如有必要，用pwd命令来检查您是否仍在项目目录下。 打开一个新的终端窗口或tab页并进入项目目录。 例如，在macOS终端上执行以下任一操作： 单击Shell，在当前工作目录选择新选项卡以打开新的终端。 点击Shell，选择新窗口，在新终端运行cd ~/ic-projects/location_hello（如果location_hello项目在ic-projects工作目录）。 + 您现在应该打开了两个已进入当前工作目录的终端。 . 执行以下命令在本地计算机上启动Internet Computer网络。 + dfx start + 根据您的平台和本地安全设置，您可能会看到一个警告。如果提示您允许或拒绝传入网络连接，请单点允许。 . 离开网络操作显示信息的终端并切换到原来的终端 . 运行以下命令为应用注册一个唯一Canister标识符： + dfx canister create --all 运行以下命令构建程序： dfx build 运行以下命令在本地部署程序： dfx canister install --all 从命令行或浏览器测试功能。 因为Internet Computer支持应用编译到标准的WebAssembly模块，您能用C, C, Objective-C和Objective-C语言标准编译器和工具和Clang编译器来生成应用程序。 为了说明如何迁移用C编写的程序以在Internet Computer上运行，让我们看一下 示例库中的简单reverse.c程序。reverse.c程序包含一个名为go的函数，该函数可以反转字符串。 要将`reverse.c`程序编译为WebAssembly，需要安装clang编译器和标准库。 您可以通过运行以下命令来检查本地计算机上是否已安装clang： clang --version 如果安装了`clang`，该命令将显示类似于以下内容的信息： clang version 10.0.0 Target: x86_64-apple-darwin19.5.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin 如果该命令未返回版本信息，请在继续之前安装clang。 根据您所使用的操作系统，安装clang的步骤会有所不同。 例如，在Debian Linux上，运行以下命令： sudo apt-get install clang lld gcc-multilib 在macOS上，您可以通过安装开发人员命令行工具或使用Homebrew安装LLVM来安装clang。 例如，如果未安装clang，请运行以下命令： brew install llvm 您可以先使用clang进行编译，然后使用wasm-ld进行链接，以将C程序编译为作为WebAssembly模块运行。 根据所使用的操作系统和Clang版本，您可能会使用其他版本的WebAssembly链接器，例如macOS上的wasm-ld或Debian上的wasm-ld-8。‌ 在macOS上编译为WebAssembly：‌ 通过运行以下clang命令来编译程序：‌ clang --target=wasm32 -c -O3 reverse.c 通过运行以下wasm-ld命令，运行链接器以创建WebAssembly模块：‌ wasm-ld --no-entry --export-dynamic --allow-undefined reverse.o -o reverse.wasm 接下来，您需要准备一个简单的配置文件，标识了能安装在Internet Computer上的reverse二进制包和一个build目录，以便您能使用dfx命令行接口来作为Canister安装并运行。‌ 准备配置文件和构建目录：‌ 使用以下命令来创建一个带有canisters键的dfx.json文件 echo '{\"canisters\":{\"reverse\":{\"main\":\"reverse\"}}}' > dfx.json 使用以下命令创建一个build目录‌ mkdir build 运行以下命令创建一个reverse目录‌ mkdir build/reverse 运行以下命令拷贝WebAssembly模块到新的build/reverse目录‌ cp reverse.wasm build/reverse/ 在标准开发工作流程中，运行dfx build命令会在Canister的输出目录中创建多个文件，包括一个或多个Candid接口描述（.did）文件，这些文件处理与程序功能关联的数据类型的类型匹配。‌ 有关用于不同数据类型的语法的详细信息，请参见Candid规范 和 Candid 指导。 为此程序创建一个Candid接口描述文件：‌ 在您为reverse.c程序源创建的build目录中打开一个终端。‌ 创建一个名为reverse.did的新文本文件。‌ 添加go函数的描述。‌ 例如： service : { \"go\": (text) -> (text); } 保存并关闭文件。 在部署和测试程序之前，您需要执行以下操作：‌ 连接到Internet Computer网络，该网络可以在您的开发环境中本地运行，也可以在您可以访问的子网中远程运行。 为应用注册一个特定网络标识。 在本地部署和测试：‌ 在本地计算机上打开一个新的终端窗口或选项卡。‌ 例如，如果在macOS上运行Terminal，请单击Shell，然后选择New Tab在当前工作目录中打开一个新终端。‌ 通过运行以下命令，在第二个终端中的本地计算机上启动Internet Computer网络：‌ dfx start 通过运行以下命令，为reverse应用程序注册唯一的容器标识符‌ dfx canister create --all 通过运行以下命令在本地网络上部署默认程序：‌ dfx canister install --all 通过运行以下命令在程序中调用go函数： dfx canister call reverse go reward (\"drawer\") 您可以在示例库中找到C程序的其他示例。","title":"使用不用的语言开发","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"work-with-languages","url":"/docs/developers-guide/work-with-languages.html","titles":[{"text":"Rust","id":"_rust"},{"text":"创建项目","id":"_创建项目"},{"text":"修改Cargo配置文件","id":"_修改cargo配置文件"},{"text":"Add a canister configuration file","id":"_add_a_canister_configuration_file"},{"text":"创建一个Candid接口描述文件","id":"_创建一个candid接口描述文件"},{"text":"修改默认程序","id":"_修改默认程序"},{"text":"连接到网络并部署","id":"_连接到网络并部署"},{"text":"Using C","id":"_using_c"},{"text":"搭建开发环境","id":"_搭建开发环境"},{"text":"将程序编译为WebAssembly","id":"_将程序编译为webassembly"},{"text":"创建一个最小的配置文件","id":"_创建一个最小的配置文件"},{"text":"创建一个最小接口描述文件","id":"_创建一个最小接口描述文件"},{"text":"部署和测试程序","id":"_部署和测试程序"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/working-with-canisters.html":{"text":"如果您已经按照链接中的教程尝试使用 DFINITY Canister 软件开发工具包 (SDK)：教程 部分或通过从链接中下载示例：示例代码库，您已经熟悉如何构建和部署程序为canister 智能合约。本节提供有关canister生命周期以及如何管理canister的信息。 根据您喜欢的开发工作流程，您可以在准备好编译程序之前或之后获取 canister 智能合约的唯一标识符。 例如，如果您想在编写任何代码之前为子网上的容器智能合约保留一个唯一标识符，您可以通过运行 dfx canister create 命令来实现。 此命令实质上创建了一个空的 canister 占位符，您可以稍后将代码安装到其中。 生成的 canister 将获得唯一标识符。 为 canister 注册唯一标识符：‌ 在本地计算机打开终端 通过运行与以下命令类似的命令，为计划创建的Canister创建一个新项目。‌ dfx new YOUR-PROJECT-NAME Note that the name you use for the project is also used as the canister name by default. Change to your new project directory. Open the dfx.json configuration file and set the host and port for the canister execution environment you want to use (e.g. the 互联网计算机 blockchain). If you are using a local deployment, you can skip this step. You can also optionally change the names of your canisters or add canister settings to the configuration file if you want to create identifiers for any additional canisters you think you will need before compiling code. Start the local canister execution environment, if necessary, by running the following command: dfx start --background In most cases, this step is only necessary if you are running the canisters locally. If you were registering canisters to run on a remote execution environment, e.g. the 互联网计算机 blockchain, you would include the --network command-line option to perform tasks on the environment specified under this parameter. Register unique identifiers for the canisters defined in the dfx.json by running the following command: dfx canister create --all The command creates the .dfx/local directory and adds the canister_ids.json file to that directory for the project. After you have written source code for your project, you need to compile it into a WebAssembly module before deploying it as a canister. If you are only compiling your project for local debugging, you can generate a locally-defined identifier for your project. To generate a locally-defined identifier: Create a project with the configuration settings and program logic to suit your needs. Start the local canister execution environment, if necessary. If you were compiling canisters to run on a remote execution environment, e.g. the 互联网计算机 blockchain, you would include the --network command-line option to perform tasks on the environment specified under this parameter. Generate hard-coded local identifiers for the canisters defined in the dfx.json by running the following command: dfx build --check Note that you must register unique canister identifiers to replace your locally-defined identifier before you can deploy the project on the 互联网计算机 blockchain. After you have compiled a program, you can install the compiled code in a canister smart contract running either on a local canister execution environment or on the 互联网计算机 blockchain. The canister identifier that was created in advance or during the build process determines where your code is installed during deployment. To deploy the code for the first time: Open a new terminal and navigate to your project directory. Start the local canister execution environment, if necessary. In most cases, this step is only necessary if you are running the canisters locally. If you were registering canisters to run on a remote execution environment, e.g. the 互联网计算机 blockchain, you would include the --network command-line option to perform tasks on the environment specified under this parameter. Verify you have canister identifiers for all of the canisters you want to deploy. Deploy all of the canisters by running the following command: dfx canister install --all All canisters have unique identifiers. You often need to use these identifiers to interact with the canister. For example, if you want to access the front-end canister for a dapp or interact with a service using the Candid web interface, you must specify the appropriate canister identifier. Because the identifiers are specific to the environment where the canisters are deployed, the files used to store the information are in different directories. For example, identifiers for a canister deployed locally are located in the project’s .dfx/local/canister_ids.json file. You can look up the canister identifier for any specific canister by running the dfx canister id command. For example, to look up the the canister identifier for the lookup canister deployed on the local canister execution environment, you could run the following command: dfx canister id lookup To look up the canister identifier for the same canister deployed on the environment specified by the ic alias, you would run the following command: dfx canister --network=ic id lookup When you are doing local development, creating a new project automatically creates a default wallet for you to use with the canisters in that project. If you want to add a wallet for projects with canisters that you have previously created, you can force dfx to generate one by taking a couple of manual steps. To add a wallet for use with an existing canister: Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory. Stop the local canister execution environment, if necessary, by running the following command: dfx stop Delete the .dfx directory. Start the local canister execution environment network by running the following command: dfx start --clean During the development cycle, you might want to install, then replace your program as you debug and improve it. In this scenario, you might want to keep the canister identifier you have registered but without preserving any of the canister code or state. For example, your canister might only have test data that you don’t want to keep or you might have decided to change the program altogether but want to reinstall under a canister identifier you used to install a previous program. To reinstall a canister: Open a new terminal and navigate to your project directory. Start the local canister execution environment, if necessary. In most cases, this step is only necessary if you are running the canisters locally. If you were registering canisters to run on a remote execution environment, e.g. the 互联网计算机 blockchain, you would include the --network command-line option to perform tasks on the environment specified under this parameter. Verify you have canister identifiers for all of the canisters you want to re-deploy. Re-deploy all of the canisters by running the following command: dfx canister install --all --mode reinstall Note that you can use the reinstall mode to replace any canister, regardless of whether the canister has code or state associated with it. In most cases, a default user identity is created for you automatically the first time you run the dfx canister create command. This default identity consists of the public and private key pair generated for your local user account. Typically, this default identity is also the default owner of all of the projects you create and all of the canisters you deploy. You can, however, proactively create and use identities of your choice to circumvent the default user identity from being used. As an example, the following scenario illustrates creating a registered_owner identity that is then used to register, build, deploy, and call the pubs project. To set an identity for a project: Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new pubs Change to the project directory by running the following command: cd pubs Start the local canister execution environment in the background by running the following command: dfx start --background Create a new registered_owner identity by running the following command: dfx identity new registered_owner Set the active user context to use the registered_owner identity by running the following command: dfx identity use registered_owner Register, build, and deploy canisters for the project by running the following commands: dfx canister create --all dfx build --all dfx canister install --all These commands run using the registered_owner identity, making that user the owner of the canisters deployed. Call the greet function to verify a successful deployment by running the following command: dfx canister call pubs greet '(\"Sam\")' After you deploy a canister, it can begin receiving and processing requests from users and from other canisters. Canisters that are available to send requests and receive replies are considered in be in a Running state. Although canisters are normally placed in the Running state by default, there are cases where you might want to temporarily or permanently stop a canister. For example, you might want to stop a canister before upgrading it. Stopping a canister helps to ensure proper handling of any messages that are in progress and need to either run to completion or be rolled back. You might also want to stop a canister to clear its message queue cleanly as a prerequisite to deleting the canister. You can check the current status of all canisters or a specified canister by running the dfx canister status command. For example, to see the status for all canisters running on the local canister execution environment, you would run the following command: dfx canister status --all This command returns output similar to the following if canisters are currently running: Canister status_check's status is Running. Canister status_check_assets's status is Running. You can stop canisters that are currently running by running the dfx canister stop command. dfx canister stop --all This command displays output similar to the following: Stopping code for canister status_check, with canister_id 75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q Stopping code for canister status_check_assets, with canister_id cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q If you were to rerun the dfx canister status command, you might see a status of Stopped indicating that there were no pending messages that needed to processed or a status of Stopping indicating that there were messages in-flight that needed to be addressed. To restart a canister-for example, after a successful canister upgrade—you can run the dfx canister start command. For example, to restart all of the canisters, you would run the following command: dfx canister start --all This command displays output similar to the following: Starting code for canister status_check, with canister_id 75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q Starting code for canister status_check_assets, with canister_id cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q Unlike a canister reinstall that preserves the canister identifier but no state, a canister upgrade enables you to preserve the state of a deployed canister, and change the code. For example, assume you have a dapp that manages professional profiles and social connections. If you want to add a new feature to the dapp, you need to be able to update the canister code without losing any of the previously-stored data. A canister upgrade enables you to update existing canister identifiers with program changes without losing the program state. To preserve state when you are upgrading a canister written in Motoko, be sure to use the stable keyword to identify the variables you want to preserve. For more information about preserving variable state in Motoko, see Stable variables and upgrade methods. If you are upgrading a canister written in Rust, you should use pre_upgrade and post_upgrade functions as illustrated in the Rust CDK asset storage example to ensure data is properly preserved after a canister upgrade. To upgrade a canister: Open a new terminal and navigate to your project directory. Start the local canister execution environment, if necessary. In most cases, this step is only necessary if you are running the canisters locally. If you were registering canisters to run on a remote execution environment, e.g. the 互联网计算机 blockchain, you would include the --network command-line option to perform tasks on the environment specified under this parameter. Verify you have canister identifiers for all of the canisters you want to upgrade. Note that your program must identify the variables for which to maintain state by using the stable keyword in the variable declaration. For more information about declaring stable variables, see the Motoko Programming Language Guide. Upgrade all of the canisters by running the following command: dfx canister install --all --mode upgrade If you want to permanently delete a specific canister or all canisters for a specific project on a given deployment (either local, or remote), you can do so by running the dfx canister delete command. Deleting a canister removes the canister identifier, code, and state. Before you can delete a canister, however, you must first stop the canister to clear any pending message requests or replies. To delete all canisters for a project: Open a new terminal and navigate to your project directory. Start the local canister execution environment, if necessary. In most cases, this step is only necessary if you are running the canisters locally. If you were deleting canisters to run on a remote execution environment, e.g. the 互联网计算机 blockchain, you would include the --network command-line option to perform tasks on the environment specified under this parameter. Check the status of the project canisters running on the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx canister status --all Stop all of the project canisters by running the following command: dfx canister stop --all Delete all of the project canisters by running the following command: dfx canister delete --all","title":"管理 canister 智能合约","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"working-with-canisters","url":"/docs/developers-guide/working-with-canisters.html","titles":[{"text":"获取 canister 标识符","id":"create-canister"},{"text":"Build a canister smart contract with a local identifier","id":"local-id"},{"text":"Deploy canister smart contracts","id":"deploy-canister"},{"text":"Look up a canister smart contract identifier","id":"lookup-id"},{"text":"Add a wallet for existing canister smart contracts","id":"add-wallet"},{"text":"Reinstall a canister smart contract","id":"reinstall-canister"},{"text":"Set an identity to own a canister smart contract","id":"set-owner"},{"text":"Managing the running state of a canister smart contract","id":"running-state"},{"text":"Upgrade a canister smart contract","id":"upgrade-canister"},{"text":"Delete a canister smart contract","id":"delete-canister"}]},"/docs/integration/ledger-quick-start.html":{"text":"This guide is an introduction to the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) components for token distribution, transaction management, token-based staking, and payments for services. The document includes an overview of the design, implementation, security guarantees, system requirements, and the application programming interface (API) that support token management for the Internet Computer Protocol. Integrate with the Internet Computer ledger is intended as a high-level overview for organizations and developers who need to understand the terminology and overall transaction management flow for Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) utility tokens. While you read this guide, be aware that additional details about specific components or interfaces might be available in subsequent documents to supplement the overview provided in this document. In addition, this overview focuses on how to integrate with the Internet Computer using the Rosetta API. Other options for integration are possible. Information about other integration options and procedures might be available in future documentation. The Internet Computer is a blockchain system comprised of several subnet blockchains for running dapps. When you write dapps that run on the Internet Computer, you deploy your program in the form of a conceptual computational unit called a canister. A canister is a \"smart contract\" in that it consists of the source code of a program as well as its running state, and is replicated on a subnet blockchain that guarantees security as well as liveness. End-users or other canisters can send messages to canister functions to perform specific operations. The messages can be either query calls that retrieve information without modifying the state of a canister or update calls that may modify the state of canister. The order in which updates are executed is agreed upon using a consensus protocol between all nodes in the subnet that runs the canister. The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) implements management of its utility token (ticker \"ICP\") using a specialized canister, called the ledger canister. There is a single ledger canister which runs alongside other canisters on a special subnet of the Internet Computer, viz., the NNS subnet. The ledger canister is a smart contract that holds accounts and transactions. These transactions either mint ICP tokens for accounts, transfer ICP tokens from one account to another, or burn ICP tokens, eliminating them from existence. The ledger canister maintains a traceable history of all transactions starting from its genesis state (initial state). An account belongs to and is controlled by the account owner who must be an IC principal. No account can be owned by two or more IC principals (no \"joint accounts\"). An account owner may control more than one account. In this case, each account corresponds to a pair (account_owner, sub_account). The sub-account is an optional bitstring which helps distinguish between the different sub-accounts of the same owner. An account on the ledger is identified by its address, which is derived from the principal ID and sub-account identifier. In this context, you can think of principal identifiers as a rough equivalent to the hash of a user’s public key for Bitcoin or Ethereum. You use the corresponding secret key to sign messages and therefore authenticate to the ledger canister and operate on the principal’s account. Canisters can also have accounts in the ledger canister, in which case the address is derived from the canister’s principal. The ledger canister is initialized using administrative operations that are internal to the Internet Computer. As part of the initialization process, the canister is created with the set of accounts and associated ICP token balances. There are three operations that can change the internal state of the ledger canister: Minting ICP tokens for accounts. Transferring ICP tokens between accounts. Burning ICP tokens. All operations are recorded as transactions in the ledger canister. The ledger maintains the transactions as a hashed blockchain, i.e., a blockchain running inside a cansiter smart contract (the ledger canister), which in turn is running on the NNS subnet blockchain. As state changes are recorded, each new transaction is placed in a block and assigned a unique index. The entire chain is regularly authenticated by signing the latest chain link. The signature used to authenticate the chain can be verified by any third party who has access to the root public key of the Internet Computer. Specific transactions can be retrieved by querying the ledger. One can interact with the Internet Computer and ledger canister in several ways. This document outlines how to integrate with the ledger canister using the Rosetta application programming interface. This is a well-documented and open standard designed to support multiple blockchain data formats and structured communication for exchange transactions. The interface is implemented by the integration software—`dfinity/rosetta-api. This piece of software enables you to deploy a passive Rosetta node outside of the Internet Computer blockchain and use the node to communicate with the ledger canister running on the Internet Computer. The following diagram provides a simplified view of the communication between the Rosetta node and the Internet Computer using the dfinity/rosetta-api integration software. As this diagram suggests, the Rosetta node maintains a local copy of the 互联网计算机 ledger canister. Periodically, the dfinity/rosetta-api software running on the Rosetta node updates its local view of the ledger by querying the ledger canister for the latest block of the ledger chain, then querying for any missing ledger blocks. The Rosetta node uses the root key of the Internet Computer to ensure that the local copy of the ledger is genuine. The integration software also allows you to use the Rosetta node to submit transactions to the 互联网计算机 ledger. The following summarizes the basic operational workflow for transferring ICP tokens if you’re using a Rosetta node to communicate with the 互联网计算机 ledger canister. In this scenario, you must be an 互联网计算机 principal who authenticates to the 互联网计算机 using a signing key stored in a wallet. After a user submits a request to the Rosetta node to make a transaction, the request is passed to the integration software running on that node to interact with the 互联网计算机 and completes the following operations: It reads from the local copy of the ledger to determine the state of the latest transaction index and block height identified by the latest_index label. It generates a random nonce value — used to ensure transactions are unique. It creates an ingress message for the ledger canister that invokes the send function and specifies the amount and the destination for the transaction: send(nonce, latest_index, dst, amount) It signs the ingress message using the key stored in the wallet to identify the principal ID for the owner. It forwards the message to the ledger canister on the Internet Computer. You can set up a Rosetta API-compliant node to interact with the Internet Computer and exchange Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) tokens. To keep the instructions simple, we use a Docker image to create the integration with the Rosetta API — one can also build and run binary using the source code. If you don’t already have Docker on your local computer, download and install the latest version. To set up a Rosetta node (which connects to a testnet): Install Docker and start the Docker daemon. The Docker daemon (dockerd) should automatically start when you reboot your computer. If you start the Docker daemon manually, the instructions vary depending on the local operating system. Pull the latest dfinity/rosetta-api image from the Docker Hub by running the following command: docker pull dfinity/rosetta-api Start the integration software by running the following command: docker run \\ --interactive \\ --tty \\ --publish 8080:8080 \\ --rm \\ dfinity/rosetta-api This command starts the software on the local host and displays output similar to the following: Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080 Starting Rosetta API server By default, the software does not connect to the ledger canister running on the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet, but rather it connects to a testnets. If you have been assigned a test network and corresponding ledger canister identifier, you can run the command against that network by specifying an additional canister argument. For example, the following command illustrates connecting to the ledger canister on a test network by setting the canister argument to 2xh5f-viaaa-aaaab-aae3q-cai. docker run \\ --interactive \\ --tty \\ --publish 8080:8080 \\ --rm \\ dfinity/rosetta-api --canister 2xh5f-viaaa-aaaab-aae3q-cai The first time you run the command it might take some time for the node to catch up to the current link of the chain. When the node is caught up, you should see output similar to the following: You are all caught up to block height 109 After completing this step, the node continues to run as a passive node that does not participate in block making. Open a new terminal window or tab and run the ps command to verify the status of the service. If you need to stop the service, press CONTROL-C. You might want to do this to change the canister identifier you are using, for example. To test the integration after setting up the node, you will need to write a program to simulate a principal submitting a transaction or looking up an account balance. When you are finished testing, you should run the Docker image in production mode without the --interactive, --tty, and --rm command-line options. These command-line options are used to attach an interactive terminal session and remove the container, and are primarily intended for testing purposes. To run the software in a production environment, you can start the Docker image using the --detach option to run the container in the background and, optionally, specify the --volume command for storing blocks. To connect the Rosetta node instance to the mainnet, add flags: --mainnet and --not-whitelisted. For more information about Docker command-line options, see the Docker reference documentation. The integration software provided in the Docker image has one requirement that is not part of the standard Rosetta API specification. For transactions involving ICP tokens, the unsigned transaction must be created less than 24 hours before the network receives the signed transaction. The reason is that the 'created_at' field of each transaction refers to an existing transaction (essentially last_index available locally at the time of transaction creation). Any submitted transaction that refers to a transaction that is too old is rejected to maintain operational efficiency. Other than this requirement, the Rosetta API integration software is fully-compliant with all standard Rosetta endpoints and passes all of the rosetta-cli tests. The software can accept any valid Rosetta request. However, the integration software only prompts for transactions to be signed using Ed25519, rather than all the signature schemes listed here and only replies with a small subset of the potential responses that the specification supports. For example, the software doesn’t implement any of the UTXO features of Rosetta, so you won’t see any UTXO messages in any of the software responses. The ICP token is similar to utility tokens governing decentralized networks such as Bitcoin, but also differs in important ways. The ICP token is similar to Bitcoin in the following ways: Each ICP token is divisible 10^8 times. All transactions are stored in the ledger starting with the genesis initial state. Tokens are entirely fungible. Account identifiers are 32 bytes and are roughly the equivalent of the hash of a public key, optionally together with some additional sub-account specifier. The ICP token differs from Bitcoin in the following ways: Rather than using proof of work, staked participant nodes use a variant of threshold BLS signatures to agree on a valid state of the chain. Any transaction can store an 8-byte memo — this memo field is used by the Rosetta API to store the nonce that distinguishes between transactions. However, other uses for the field are possible. The following questions are taken from the most commonly reported questions and blockers from the developer community regarding Rosetta integration with the 互联网计算机. An easy way to accomplish this is to use the dfinity/rosetta-api Docker image. Once the node initializes and syncs all blocks, you can perform queries and submit transactions by invoking the Rosetta API on the node. The node listens on the 8080 port. Use flags --mainnet and --not-whitelisted Use flags --mainnet and --not-whitelisted Search the Starting Rosetta API server startup log. There will be a log entry that says You are all caught up to block XX. This message confirms that you are caught up with all blocks. Mount the /data directory elsewhere. Not yet. Before launch, when we push to the dfinity/rosetta-api:latest image, it’s usually a major update that we’ll announce in our communication channels beforehand. We’ll soon implement nightly builds of the image, and CI will ensure it works before pushing. Other than latest, those images will also be tagged with the build date, so for more reproducibility, it’s possible to use the image of a specific date tag rather than latest. We’ll announce when nightly builds become available. Start dfinity/rosetta-api with --help, you can see some additional CLI arguments that can be passed. Among those there are --canister-id and --ic-url which can be used to configure the ledger destination. At the moment, they default to the test net. Note: The main net is not live yet; it will be live some time before the publicly announced date, and we’ll push the updated image to point to the main net to ensure you can perform testing on the main net beforehand. Generate an ED25519 keypair. The secret key is used for signing transactions. The public key is used for generating a self-authenticating Principal ID. For more information, see: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#_principals. The Principal ID is hashed to generate the account address. Call the /construction/derive endpoint with the hex-encoded 32-byte public key. Call the pub_key_to_address function in the JavaScript SDK. After hex decoding, the first 4 bytes is the big-endian CRC32 checksum of the rest of the address. Call address_from_hex in the JavaScript SDK. It returns and error if checksum doesn’t match. Here is a Java implementation of address validation logic. signature_type is \"ed25519\" curve_type is \"edwards25519\" Each block as queried from the /block endpoint contains exactly one transaction. Note that some operations, such as burn, are not suppoted in Rosetta API calls. Transfer Operation 0: type \"TRANSACTION\", subtracts the transfer amount from the source account. Operation 1: type \"TRANSACTION\", adds the same transfer amount to the destination account. Operation 2: type \"FEE\", subtracts the fee from the source account. Don’t rely on the order above, you can rearrange them in the /construction/payloads call, and when parsing transactions in a block, you should check for transaction type and amount sign instead. Mint Operation 0: type \"MINT\", adds the minted amount to the destination account. Burn Operation 0: type \"BURN\", subtract the burned amount from the source account. \"status\" is always \"COMPLETED\", failed transactions don’t show up in the polled blocks By calling /construction/metadata, you can get suggested_fee. At the moment, suggested_fee is a constant, and the fee specified in a transfer must be equal to it. Fees do not apply to Mint or Burn operations. The Rosetta server will wait for a short period of time after a /construction/submit call, if the transaction hit the chain, it’ll be returned. In case of an error from the ledger, the error information will be available in the /construction/submit result. It’s still possible that a /construction/submit call has returned successfully, but there’s still some time before it hits the chain. You can poll latest blocks and search for the transaction hash. We also implemented a subset of the /search/transactions endpoint which allows searching for a transaction given its hash. 5 minutes is a worst case timeout. Don’t use mempool APIs, our implementation is an empty stub. Successful calls always have 200 response status code. Failed calls always have 500 response status code, with a JSON payload containing more information. The possible Rosetta error codes and their text descriptions can be seen in the /network/options call result. Mint is a privileged operation; we don’t support Burn through Rosetta API calls at the moment. The ledger rejects duplicate transactions. Only the first transaction will make it to the chain and for the duplicate submissions the /construction/submit call will fail. The JavaScript SDK contains an implementation of the offline signing logic. This is deeply coupled with internal implementation details, so we strongly advise you to call /construction/combine to sign a transaction if possible. In the /construction/payloads call, you can add one or all of the ingress_start / ingress_end fields to specify the ingress time period. They are nanoseconds since the Unix epoch, and must be within the next 24 hours. This enables generating & signing a transaction, but delaying the actual submission to a later time. The JavaScript SDK supports deserializing a signed_transaction hex string and recovering some information about the transfer. This may be useful in the case that you’d like to perform a sanity check.","title":"Integrate with the Internet Computer ledger","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"ledger-quick-start","url":"/docs/integration/ledger-quick-start.html","titles":[{"text":"Basic terminology","id":"_basic_terminology"},{"text":"Ledger canister overview","id":"_ledger_canister_overview"},{"text":"Accounts","id":"_accounts"},{"text":"Transaction types","id":"_transaction_types"},{"text":"Integrate with the 互联网计算机 ledger canister using the Rosetta API","id":"_integrate_with_the_互联网计算机_ledger_canister_using_the_rosetta_api"},{"text":"Integration workflow overview","id":"_integration_workflow_overview"},{"text":"Set up a Rosetta node","id":"_set_up_a_rosetta_node"},{"text":"Run the Rosetta node in production","id":"_run_the_rosetta_node_in_production"},{"text":"Requirements and limitations","id":"_requirements_and_limitations"},{"text":"Basic properties for ICP utility tokens","id":"_basic_properties_for_icp_utility_tokens"},{"text":"Frequently asked questions","id":"_frequently_asked_questions"},{"text":"The Rosetta node","id":"_the_rosetta_node"},{"text":"How to I run an instance of the Rosetta node?","id":"_how_to_i_run_an_instance_of_the_rosetta_node"},{"text":"How do I connect the Rosetta node to the mainnet?","id":"_how_do_i_connect_the_rosetta_node_to_the_mainnet"},{"text":"How do I connect the Rosetta node to the mainnet?","id":"_how_do_i_connect_the_rosetta_node_to_the_mainnet_2"},{"text":"How do I know if the node has caught up with the test net?","id":"_how_do_i_know_if_the_node_has_caught_up_with_the_test_net"},{"text":"How to persist synced blocks data?","id":"_how_to_persist_synced_blocks_data"},{"text":"Is the Rosetta node versioned?","id":"_is_the_rosetta_node_versioned"},{"text":"How do I connect to the main net instead of the test net?","id":"_how_do_i_connect_to_the_main_net_instead_of_the_test_net"},{"text":"ICP-specific Rosetta API details","id":"_icp_specific_rosetta_api_details"},{"text":"How are accounts generated and verified?","id":"_how_are_accounts_generated_and_verified"},{"text":"How to use the public key to generate its account address?","id":"_how_to_use_the_public_key_to_generate_its_account_address"},{"text":"How to verify the checksum of an account address?","id":"_how_to_verify_the_checksum_of_an_account_address"},{"text":"What are signature_type and curve_type for ED25519?","id":"_what_are_signature_type_and_curve_type_for_ed25519"},{"text":"What kinds of transactions can appear in a block, and what do they mean?","id":"_what_kinds_of_transactions_can_appear_in_a_block_and_what_do_they_mean"},{"text":"What fee is needed?

The Internet Computer hosts special smart contracts, called canisters. A canister smart contract is a bundle of WebAssembly bytecode logic and memory pages. Dapps on the Internet Computer are created from one or more canisters. Canister smart contracts can serve web content directly to end-users, e.g., in their browsers, and users can interact with blockchain services without holding tokens. The Internet Computer blockchain can eventually host any number of canister smart contracts (i.e., code & state). Moreover, it can run them concurrently with unbounded on-chain capacity. This means you can create dapps that scale. Canister smart contracts are unstoppable and tamperproof. Imagine building without having to worry about databases, caches, firewalls, CDNs, cloud providers, VPNs, DNS, and even usernames & passwords — all because the Internet Computer abstracts these needs away.

DFINITY Canister SDK 并想在本地 canister 执行环境中运行一份 canister 智能合约，而不是部署在 互联网计算机 区块链上。 首先，我们构建并部署一个简单的 Hello canister，它只有一个叫做 greet 的函数。如果使用命令行运行 canister 或在浏览器页面中访问 canister ，greet 功能将接收一个文本参数并在一个终端中返回类似于 “Hello，everyone！” 的消息。 在下载并安装此版本的 DFINITY Canister SDK 之前，请确保： 已连接互联网，并可以通过 macOS 或者 Linux 访问本地的 shell 终端。 目前，DFINITY Canister SDK 只可在 macOS 或者 Linux 系统中运行。 如果想在项目前端开发中使用 SDK 的默认的前端模板文件，请安装 node.js。 如果您不确定如何在本地计算机上打开新的终端或如何安装 node.js，请参阅 新手基础教程。如果您能够满足上述条件，请继续下载和安装。 你可以直接从本地计算机终端下载最新版本的 DFINITY Canister 软件开发工具包 (SDK) 下载和安装： 打开本地 shell 终端 打开“应用程序”、“实用程序”，然后双击“Terminal ”或按 ⌘+空格 打开搜索栏后输入终端。 通过运行以下命令下载并安装 DFINITY Canister 软件开发工具包 (SDK): sh -ci \"$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)\" 此命令将提示您在安装 DFINITY 命令行(CLI)及本地计算机的依赖项之前，先阅读并接受许可协议。 输入 y 并按回车键继续安装。 该命令将显示在本地计算机上正在安装的组件信息。 如果您在安装运行脚本时没有任何错误，则您启动的在计算机互联网平台上运行的程序都可以在本地计算机上使用。 验证 SDK 已经可以使用: 打开本地 shell 终端 检查是否安装了 DFINITY 命令行程序以及 `dfx`是否在当前路径中可用： dfx --version 该命令会显示版本信息，如下所示： dfx 0.8.2 通过运行以下命令， 预览 dfx 的子命令的信息： dfx --help 该命令将显示 dfx 父命令及其子命令的使用信息。 互联网计算机 上的 Dapp 以 projects 的形式呈现. 您可以使用 dfx 父命令及其子命令来创建 projects 在本教程中，我们将从默认示例 dapp 开始，以说明使用项目中的启动文件创建 dapp。 当您创建一个新项目时，dfx 命令行会向您的工作区添加一个默认的项目目录结构。 我们在 探索基础项目 教程中介绍了构成项目目录的模板文件。 为你的第一个应用创建一个 project: 打开本地 shell 终端 通过运行以下命令来创建一个名为 hello 的新项目： dfx new hello dfx new hello 命令创建了一个 新的 hello 项目，其中包含默认项目目录、一些模板文件和项目的 Git 存储库。 如果您使用的是不同的项目名称而不是 hello，请记下您使用的名称。您需要在这些说明中使用新的项目名称而不是hello。 通过运行以下命令更改项目目录： cd hello 在构建第一个项目之前，您需要连接到IC网络，这个网络可以是在你本地开发环境中运行的，也可以是在你能访问到的子网络上远程运行的。 这些说明的前提是您正在运行本地Internet网络。如果要连接到外部Internet计算机网络，则可以跳过此部分。作为最佳做法，此步骤需要打开两个终端，以便可以在一个终端中启动并查看网络操作，并在另一个终端中管理项目。 启动本地网络： 在本地计算机上打开新的第二个终端窗口或选项卡。 如果有必要，请导航至项目的根目录。 现在应该保持两个终端呈打开状态，并将项目目录作为两个终端的当前工作目录。 通过运行以下命令，在本地计算机上的第二个终端启动IC网络： dfx start 如果系统提示您选择“允许或拒绝传入的网络连接”，请单击“允许”。启动本地网络后，会看到IC副本启动的消息以及当前网络配置的详细信息。 将显示网络操作的终端窗口打开，并切换到创建新项目的第一个终端窗口。 您可以在终端中执行不显示网络操作的其余步骤。 当在开发环境中连接至本地运行的IC网络后，您可以在本地注册、构建和部署应用程序。 在本地部署第一个应用程序： 如有必要，请检查您是否仍在项目的根目录中。 如有必要，请通过运行以下命令确保 node modules 文件夹在项目目录中可用： npm install 有关此步骤的详细信息，请参阅 阅确保项目节点可用 章节。 通过运行以下命令来注册、构建和部署第一个应用程序： dfx deploy 输出 dfx deploy 命令将显示执行操作的信息。例如，此步骤会注册两个网络特定标识符（一个用于 hello 主程序，一个用于 hello_assets 前端用户界面）以及类似以下内容的安装信息： Creating the \"default\" identity. - generating new key at /Users/pubs/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem Created the \"default\" identity. Deploying all canisters. Creating canisters... Creating canister \"hello\"... Creating the canister using the wallet canister... Creating a wallet canister on the local network. The wallet canister on the \"local\" network for user \"default\" is \"rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai\" \"hello\" canister created with canister id: \"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai\" Creating canister \"hello_assets\"...

Uploading assets to asset canister... Deployed canisters. 但是，如果您创建了一个不同名称的项目，那么您的 canister 名称将与您的项目名称相匹配，而不是与 hello, hello_assets 匹配。 第一次部署时，dfx 将创建默认身份和由默认身份控制的本地 cycles 钱包。 还应注意，cycles 钱包是一种特殊的 canister，可以使您能将 cycles 转移到其他 canister。 要在本地部署此示例 dapp，您无需了解有关默认开发人员身份、使用 cycles 钱包或管理 cycles 的任何信息。 我们稍后将介绍这些主题，但现在，请注意这些东西都会自动创建。 通过运行以下命令调用 hello 容器和预定义greet功能： dfx canister call hello greet everyone 我们仔细观察一下这个命令： dfx canister call 命令需要明确一个 canister 的名字以及一个要调用的方法或者函数。 hello 明确了将要调用的 canister 的名称。 greet 指定了要在 hello canister 中调用的函数名称。 everyone 是你想要传递给 greet 函数的文本类型参数。 但请记住，如果创建了不同名称的项目，canister 名称将与新的项目名称匹配，您需要修改命令行以匹配您使用的名称而不是 hello。 验证命令并显示 greet 功能的返回值。 例如： (\"Hello, everyone!\") 既然您已部署应用程序并使用命令行测试了其操作，那么让我们验证是否可以使用网络浏览器访问前端弹出窗口。 使用 `npm start 打开开发服务器 打开浏览器 输入 http://localhost:8080/ 导航到此 URL 会显示一个简单的 HTML 页面，其中包含一个示例图像文件、一个输入字段和一个按钮。 例如: + 输入一个端文本, 然后点击 Click Me 就会返回依据问候语. 例如: 在浏览器中测试该应用程序后，您可以停止本地IC网络，使其不在后台运行。 停止本地网络： 在显示开发服务器终端界面中，按 Control-C 键以中断本地网络进程。 在显示网络操作的终端中，按 Control-C 键以中断本地网络进程。 通过运行以下命令，停止在本地计算机上运行的Internet网络： dfx stop 这个快速入门教程只涉及几个关键步骤用来介绍您开发自己的项目时所遵循的基本工作流程。在教学指引 和 Motoko 编程语言导引中，有更多详细的示例和教程供您探索。 您可以在文档中找到更详细的示例和教程，以帮助您了解如何使用 Motoko 以及如何开发 dapps 以在 互联网计算机 区块链上运行 dapps。

例如，您可以使用硬件安全模块 (HSM) 设备、通过网络神经系统 (NNS) 前端应用程序或使用 DFINITY Canister SDK dfx` 命令行工具。 每种方法都提供了一个不同的界面，用于签署和发送消息到Ledger并代表您作为帐户持有人的身份。 首次使用 DFINITY Canister SDK 时，dfx 命令行工具会为您创建默认的开发人员身份。 此身份由主体数据类型和主体的文本表示形式表示，通常称为 principal 标识符。这种身份表示类似于比特币或以太坊地址。 但是，与您的开发人员身份相关联的委托人通常与帐户标识符不同。 principal 标识符和帐户标识符是相关的——两者都提供您身份的文本表示——但它们使用不同的格式。 出于本教程的目的 - 在没有硬件钱包或外部应用程序连接到 Ledger 的情况下 - 我们将使用您的开发人员身份来检索您的帐户标识符，然后将 ICP 代币从帐户转移到cycles钱包。 在 Ledger 中查找您的帐户： 运行以下命令确认您当前开发者身份： dfx identity whoami 在大多数情况下，您应该看到您当前使用的是默认的开发者身份。 例如： default 运行以下命令查看当前账户。 dfx identity get-principal 输出如下所示： tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe 运行以下命令获取您的开发人员身份的帐户标识符： dfx ledger account-id 此命令显示与您的开发人员身份关联的帐户标识符。 例如，您应该会看到类似于以下内容的输出： 03e3d86f29a069c6f2c5c48e01bc084e4ea18ad02b0eec8fccadf4487183c223 运行以下命令显示账户余额： dfx ledger --network ic balance 此命令显示帐户中的 ICP 代币余额。 例如，您应该会看到类似于以下内容的输出： 10.00000000 ICP 现在您已经确认了您的账户信息和当前的 ICP 代币余额，您可以将其中一些 ICP 代币转换为Cycles并将它们移动到Cycles钱包中。 转移 ICP 代币以创建Cycles钱包： 运行类似于以下的命令，从您的帐户转移 ICP 代币来创建一个带有Cycles的新 Canister dfx ledger --network ic create-canister --amount 此命令将您为 --amount 参数指定的 ICP 令牌数量转换为Cycles，并将Cycles与由您指定的控制账户标识符相关联。 例如，以下命令将 .25 个 ICP 令牌转换为Cycles，并将默认身份的账户标识符指定为新Canister的控制器： dfx ledger --network ic create-canister tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe --amount .25 如果交易成功，Ledger会记录该事件，您应该会看到类似于以下内容的输出： Transfer sent at BlockHeight: 20 Canister created with id:

However, there are often multiple ways to perform each of these tasks. If you need more help than provided here, see the documentation for the operating system you are using. The instructions here assume that you are using a macOS computer. If you have a Linux development environment, the steps to follow depend on the specific Linux distribution and version you use. Before you install the DFINITY Canister SDK, you need to know: How to open and run commands in a terminal How to check for and install packages and dependencies How to create and navigate to new directories How to view and update your PATH on the platform you use The steps in this section describe how to prepare a basic development environment. You need to know how to open a terminal and navigate to directories to install the DFINITY Canister SDK and to start and stop the 互联网计算机 running locally when trying any of the tutorials. To open the Terminal application on macOS: Open the Finder. Click Applications, open Utilities, then double-click Terminal. Alternatively, you can press the ⌘+spacebar keyboard keys to open Search, then type terminal. The terminal is where you are going to execute command-line instructions. To execute a command, you type or copy and paste an instruction, then press Return. Check your current path by running the print working directory–pwd—command, then pressing Return. pwd This command displays your current directory with a path like /Users/. After you open the Terminal application, you can open new terminal shell at any time by clicking Shell, then selecting New Window or New Tab. By default, a new terminal shell always opens in your home directory with a path like /Users/. The Homebrew application is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install and update packages—that is, external programs—that you need to have available in a local development environment. The node.js package provides a JavaScript runtime environment and modules for front-end user interface development. The node.js package is not required to build programs, but you’ll probably need it if you want to add a graphical user interface to your program. If your development environment is Linux, you can use a package manager of your choice instead of Homebrew to install packages and manage dependencies. To check and install packages: Check whether you have the Homebrew package manager installed by running the following command: brew --version If the command returns version information, continue to the next step. If Homebrew isn’t installed, copy and paste the following command in your terminal: /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\" Check whether you have the node.js package manager installed by running the following command: node --version If the command returns version information, continue to Create a working folder. If node.js isn’t installed, copy and paste the following command in your terminal: brew install node By default, a new terminal shell always opens in your home directory with a path like /Users/. To keep your workspace tidy, you can create a separate folder for your 互联网计算机 projects. Creating a working folder for 互联网计算机 projects is optional, but can make it easier to find and navigate between projects. A separate folder is especially useful if you plan to experiment with any of the tutorials beyond the Quick start. To create a new working folder: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Create a new folder called ic-projects in your home directory by running the following command: mkdir ic-projects Change to the new working folder by running the following command: cd ic-projects The PATH environment variable is an important setting that your operating system uses to locate the set of directories where executable programs are located. Because every operating system has its own set of directories where it expects to find programs, you need to know how to view and update the PATH environment variable so that you can verify that the DFINITY Canister SDK command-line executable—dfx—is in one of the directories listed. On macOS computers, the default location for the dfx executable is /usr/local/bin and this directory is typically included in the default set of paths. Therefore, updating the PATH variable is usually not necessary for computers running macOS. If you are using a Linux distribution, however, you should know how to do the following: Verify the location of the dfx executable. View the set of directories in your current PATH. Update the PATH environment variable, if necessary. On most operating systems, you can run a command similar to the following to view the set of directories in your current PATH: export $PATH To check the location of the dfx executable after you install the DFINITY Canister SDK, you might run a command similar to the following: which dfx If the dfx executable is not in one of the directories listed in your current $PATH, you need to move the executable or update the PATH setting. The specific steps for updating the PATH depend on your operating system, but, in many cases, you can run a command similar to the following and specifying the appropriate directory, such as ~/bin: export PATH= Now you’re ready to install the DFINITY Canister SDK and get coding!","title":"Preliminary steps for newcomers","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"newcomers","url":"/docs/quickstart/newcomers.html","titles":[{"text":"Open a terminal","id":"open-terminal"},{"text":"Check for packages","id":"check-pkgs"},{"text":"Create a working folder","id":"working-folder"},{"text":"View directories in your PATH","id":"check-path"}]},"/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html":{"text":"DFINITY Canister 软件开发工具包 (SDK) 提供工具、示例代码和文档，可帮助您创建在 Internet Computer网络上运行的程序。 快速入门教程假设您是第一次安装 DFINITY Canister SDK，并说明如何创建、构建和部署您的第一个应用程序。 为了使说明简单并专注于手头的任务，快速入门分为两个场景： 在 本地开发 章节, 您使用本地运行的 Internet computer 进程创建和部署示例应用程序，以模拟连接到网络。 在 On-chain deployment 章节, 您在本地创建示例应用程序，但远程连接到外部数据中心的Internet Computer网络。 如果您在设置开发环境时需要一些帮助——例如，如果您不确定如何打开新终端、安装软件包或创建文件夹并在目录之间导航——您可能需要从新手的预备步骤开始。 这两个章节都构建和部署了一个简单的 Hello 应用程序，该应用程序只有一个 greet greet 函数接受一个文本参数并返回（命令行运行应用程序时在终端，浏览器访问应用程序时在弹出窗口）一个问候语。 默认 dapp 包含用 Motoko 写的后端代码，Motoko 是一门专门为与 互联网计算机 交互而设计的编程语言，以及一个简单的基于 webpack 的前端。 正如 代币和 cycles 中所讨论的，需要 Cycles 来为 Internet Computer上运行的应用程序的Canister操作赋能。作为开发人员，您有几种不同的选择来获取和管理应用程序的Cycles： 交易所购买ICP 代币，然后使用 DFINITY Canister SDK 命令行或网络神经系统应用程序将您的代币转换为Cycles。 通过提供这些服务的提供商注册帐户或Cycles钱包。 通过Cycles钱包或其他应用直接从Canister中发送和接收。 因为只有Canister需要和消耗Cycles——执行操作并为它们使用的资源付费——cycles总是在Canister之间转移，而不是给用户或开发者。 但是，您可以通过为您创建的Cycles钱包或使用类似的应用程序来管理Cycles的分配。 如果您在开始之前想查看更多信息，或者想在亲自尝试之前查看如何部署的演示，请查看以下相关资源： 如何使用 ICP 代币（概述） 在 Internet Computer上构建：基础知识（视频） DFINITY Canister SDK是什么（视频） 部署您的第一个应用程序（视频）","title":"Quick start","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"quickstart-intro","url":"/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html","titles":[{"text":"默认应用","id":"default-app"},{"text":"获取 ICP 代币和 Cycles","id":"_获取_icp_代币和_cycles"},{"text":"想了解更多","id":"_想了解更多"}]},"/docs/release-notes/0.6.20-rn.html":{"text":"The 0.6.20 release has both user-facing and internal enhancements, including fixes and updates to Motoko, the Motoko base library, and Candid.

The most significant new features and capabilities include updates in the following functional areas: DFX Candid Motoko With this release, you must have a wallet canister with cycles to deploy or manage applications on the 互联网计算机. For local development, dfx automatically creates a wallet for you when you run dfx canister create or dfx deploy commands within each project. Wallets are also created automatically if you deploy to the 互联网计算机 using the ic network alias before the network is upgraded to require a cycle balance. To deploy and manage applications on the main 互联网计算机 network, you must provide the DFINITY Foundation with a principal associated with your user identity and receive a wallet canister identifier in return. To deploy applications on the 互联网计算机 network: Download and install the DFINITY Canister SDK. Run the dfx identity get-principal command to create your default identity and principal: dfx identity get-principal Running the command displays output similar to the following: Creating the \"default\" identity. - generating new key at /Users/pubs/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem Created the \"default\" identity. wre5u-xietp-k5jz4-sdaaz-g3x4l-zjzxa-lxnly-fp2mk-j3j77-25qat-pqe Run the dfx identity set-wallet command to associate your wallet canister identifier with your default identity. dfx identity set-wallet Open the wallet application in a web browser by navigating to the canister with a URL similar to the following: https://.ic0.app A new command-line option enables you to specify the number of initial cycles to transfer to a newly-created canister. The dfx canister create and dfx deploy commands now support a new --with-cycles option. This option allows you to specify the initial cycle balance of a canister created by your wallet. You can use this option when running the 互联网计算机 network locally or connected to the current ic network (Sodium) for testing purposes. However, because wallets and cycle balances are not currently used for canisters you create while connected to the current ic network (Sodium), the --with-cycles option does not affect any canister operations. For example, you might run the following dfx canister create command to initialize 8000000000 cycles for all of the canisters in a project: dfx canister create --with-cycles 8000000000 --all If using dfx deploy, you might run the following command to initialize 8000000000 cycles for the backend canister in a project: dfx deploy --with-cycles 8000000000 backend You must have a wallet canister with a cycles balance on the network where you want to create or deploy additional canisters. You can now use the new dfx toolchain command to manage the version of the dfx command-line interface you are using for your projects. The dfx toolchain command enables you to install, uninstall, and set the default version of dfx that you want to use. You can specify the version by the complete version number, the major and minor version number, or a tag name. For example: dfx toolchain install 0.6.24 # complete version dfx toolchain install 0.6 # major minor version dfx toolchain install latest # tag name A new deploy-wallet subcommand enables you to specify the canister identifier for your cycles wallet WebAssembly module (WASM). For example, if you have an account with a third party exchange provider and receive a wallet canister identifier, you can run a command similar to the following to deploy the wallet and uses its cycles for development: dfx identity deploy-wallet The deploy-wallet feature is intended for a future use case. The command is only applicable if you received the wallet canister identifier as part of a transfer operation that converted ICP tokens to cycles. In addition, the deploy-wallet subcommand is not intended for use with the current version of 互联网计算机 running locally or on the remote network. New Candid documentation for developers provides type mapping information for Rust and JavaScript. Candid now supports additional native Rust types and Typescript. For additional information, see the Candid changelog. The Motoko compiler (moc) now accepts the -Werror flag to turn warnings into errors. The language server now returns documentation comments alongside completions and hover notifications. Motoko supports wrapping arithmetic and bit-wise operations on NatN and IntN. The conventional arithmetic operators on NatN and IntN trap on overflow. If wrap-around semantics is desired, the operators +%, -%, % and *% can be used. The corresponding assignment operators (+%= etc.) are also available. Likewise, the bit fiddling operators (&, |, ^, >, ,<>> etc.) are now also available on NatN and IntN. The right shift operator (>>) is an unsigned right shift on NatN and a signed right shift on IntN; the +>> operator is not available on these types. The motivation for this change is to eventually deprecate and remove the WordN types. Therefore, the wrapping arithmetic operations on WordN are deprecated and their use will print a warning. For information about replacing Word types, see Word types. For values x of type Blob, an iterator over the elements of the blob x.vals() is introduced. It works like x.bytes(), but returns the elements as type Nat8. The base library documentation tool mo-doc now generates cross-references for types in signatures. With this enhancement, when you view a signature like fromIter : I.Iter → List.List, you can click I.Iter or List.List to navigate to the appropriate definition. Improvements to the type checker and compiler provide better handling for object literals. This section covers any reported issues that have been fixed in this release.

You can now use the CANISTER_ID_{canister.name} and CANISTER_CANDID_PATH_{canister.name} environment variables to reference canister identifiers and the path to the canister Candid description (.did file) during the build process. These environment variables enable you to construct the JavaScript for front-end assets using the correct canister identifiers. The environment variables are intended to replace the import syntax for dependent canisters described in Entry and output configuration which is being deprecated and will be removed in a future release. A new dfx identity import subcommand enables you to import a security certificate to create an identity. For example, if you use a hardware wallet or a key generation utility to generate a PEM file for authenticating your identity, you can now import that PEM file into dfx to create a new identity. After importing the PEM file, you can run the dfx identity use command to set that identity as your default context. For example, to import the my-external-id.pem and create an identity named alice, you would run the following command: dfx identity import alice my-external-id.pem After running this command, you would run the following command to begin using the new identity: dfx identity use alice This section covers any reported issues that have been fixed in this release.

The 互联网计算机 Interface Specification details many technical properties that describe the lower-level interfaces for interacting with the 互联网计算机. For example, the 互联网计算机 Interface Specification describes the HTTPS endpoints that are exposed to handle incoming requests and how low-level bindings enable canisters to interact with system components. If you use existing tools—like the DFINITY Canister SDK or Canister Development Kit for Rust—to work with canisters, these tools interact with the lower-level interfaces described in the 互联网计算机 Interface Specification on your behalf. If you want to create your own tooling for working with canisters, however, the 互联网计算机 Interface Specification includes the technical details you need to understand how the 互联网计算机 external interfaces work. If you are interested in expanding the 互联网计算机 ecosystem, you’ll also find information in the 互联网计算机 Interface Specification to help you in developing the following types of projects: Building front-end agents for user-facing interaction in any programming language, including popular languages such as Python, Golang, or C.

This section covers any known issues or limitations that might affect how you work with the DFINITY Canister SDK in specific environments or scenarios. The introduction of the cycles wallet canister changes the default principal used to perform key canister management tasks, such as registering a new canister identifier and deploying a new canister on the 互联网计算机. This change introduces some inconsistencies in the identity used to perform certain tasks and can result in potential access control issues. You should note that none of the tutorials have been updated to reflect this specific change in behavior yet and the current version of the Add access control with identities tutorial is known to be invalid for this release. If you want to experiment with access control using the Add access control with identities tutorial, you should install the DFINITY Canister SDK version 0.6.23 (or older). If you access the @dfinity/agent JavaScript agent directly in a project—that is, without going through the bootstrap server—you will not be able to import the bls certification scheme with the agent-js release. If your application uses the JavaScript agent directly, you should use the latest version of the agent.","title":"Highlights of what’s new in 0.6.26","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"0.6.26-rn","url":"/docs/release-notes/0.6.26-rn.html","titles":[{"text":"New features and capabilities","id":"_new_features_and_capabilities"},{"text":"Issues fixed in this release","id":"_issues_fixed_in_this_release"},{"text":"Known issues and limitations","id":"_known_issues_and_limitations"},{"text":"Only the default wallet canister principal can perform canister management tasks","id":"_only_the_default_wallet_canister_principal_can_perform_canister_management_tasks"},{"text":"Incompatibility when using the JavaScript agent directly in a project","id":"_incompatibility_when_using_the_javascript_agent_directly_in_a_project"}]},"/docs/release-notes/0.7.0-rn.html":{"text":"The 0.7.0 release primarily consists of changes to support new features that are not yet complete, including fixes and updates to DFX commands, Motoko, the Motoko base library, and Candid. The most significant new features and capabilities are updates to the following: DFX Motoko Addition of ledger subcommands dfx now supports a dedicated dfx ledger subcommand. This allows you to interact with the ledger canister installed on the Internet Computer. Example commands include dfx ledger account-id which prints the Account Identifier associated with your selected identity, dfx ledger transfer which allows you to transfer ICP from your ledger account to another, and dfx ledger create-canister which allows you to create a canister from ICP. For more information on dfx ledger subcommands, see dfx ledger. Addition of wallet subcommands dfx now supports a dedicated dfx wallet subcommand. This allows you to interact with the cycles wallet associated with your selected identity. The following are just some of the available commands: dfx wallet balance returns the selected identity’s cycles wallet balance. dfx wallet list-addresses displays the assigned controllers & custodians of the cycles wallet. You can use dfx wallet send to send cycles to another wallet. For more information on dfx wallet see dfx wallet. Add an output type to the request-status subcommand. This change allows you to specify the format for the return result for dfx canister request-status. Formatting options include idl, raw, and pp. The default network for projects is now ic. The default network is now the mainnet ic unless otherwise specified. Additionally, --network ic now points to the mainnet 互联网计算机 (Sodium has been deprecated.) Automatic creation of a candid UI canister A dedicated candid UI canister is installed on a local network when using dfx canister install or dfx deploy. Compress some content types You can now store gzip content encodings of assets with media types if the encoding is smaller than the source contents. Supported file types are text/*, */javascript, and */html. Add the encoding size when listing assets Now when assets are listed, a new length field returns the size of encodings. Add new command dfx canister info This allows you to retrieve certified canister information. Access to this information is limited to the controller of the canister and the SHA256 hash of its WASM module. If there is no WASM module installed, the hash will be None. New method deletes asset canister assets that no longer exist in a project—breaking change The keys() method is no longer supported. Use the list() method to delete missing project assets. For example: assert_command dfx canister call --query e2e_project_assets get '(record{key=\"/will-delete-this.txt\";accept_encodings=vec{\"identity\"}})' assert_command dfx canister call --query e2e_project_assets list '(record{})' assert_match '\"/will-delete-this.txt\"' Run an emulator instead of the replica To run a dfx project using an emulator instead of the replica, you can now run dfx start --emulator. Rely on npmjs.org to get the version of agent-js to install This decouples the version of dfx from the release version of agent-js. Additionally, it allows for debug builds to install properly (as dfx has a non-release version). You can now install the DFINITY Canister SDK on for M1 Macs running Darwin. Allow upload of assets of any size to the asset canister. The following asset canister call methods are added: create_batch() create_chunk() commit_batch() get() ** get_chunk() + Reworks the asset installer in dfx to use these methods. It can therefore upload assets that exceed the message ingress size. Add --no-wallet flag and --wallet option --no-wallet allows users to bypass specifying a wallet ID. --wallet allows users to specify a particular wallet to use for calls. Implement the HTTP request proposal in dfx bootstrap webserver Adds support for http requests in the base storage canister (with a default to /index.html). This does not support encodings other than identity, and doesn’t return any headers. This also upgrades tokio and reqwest in order to work correctly. There are some performance issues to note (this is slower than the icx-http-server). Reformat to style guidelines. Add type bindings Add Nat.Nat, Nat8.Nat8, etc. to libraries for primitive types. This section covers any reported issues that have been fixed in this release. Deleting a canister on a network removes entries for other networks This change fixes a bug where deleting a canister on a network removed all other entries for the canister in the canister_ids.json file. Error message: already in use (os error 48) when issuing dfx start. This fixes an error which occurred when starting a replica soon after stopping it. The dfx new command should not require node This fixes the inability to use the dfx new command to create projects on machines that do not have node.js installed. Missing webpack.config plugin This adds the missing ProvidePlugin to webpack.config for new projects. Allow new projects assets to contain non-utf8 files Previously assets were forced to be valid UTF-8 strings. After this change if a string cannot be converted, in-place variable replacements are ignored. No longer confused by distinct, but eponymous, type definitions. Numbers of eponymous types and specializations from 1 (not 2) Avoids long chains of type equalities by normalizing before translation","title":"Highlights of what’s new in 0.7.0","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"0.7.0-rn","url":"/docs/release-notes/0.7.0-rn.html","titles":[{"text":"New features and capabilities","id":"_new_features_and_capabilities"},{"text":"DFX","id":"_dfx"},{"text":"Motoko","id":"_motoko"},{"text":"Issues fixed in this release","id":"_issues_fixed_in_this_release"},{"text":"DFX","id":"_dfx_2"},{"text":"Motoko","id":"_motoko_2"}]},"/docs/release-notes/0.7.1-rn.html":{"text":"The 0.7.1 release includes new features and fixes to DFX commands, Motoko, the Motoko base library, and Candid. The most significant new features and capabilities include the following updates for DFX commands: An update to the dfx canister sign command enables you to sign request_status messages for update calls. If you are using dfx canister sign to call a method that generates an update message, the command also signs a corresponding request_status message and appends it to the message.json file as signed_request_status. After you send the message using the dfx canister send command, you can check the request_status of the call by running the following command: dfx canister send message.json --status This change is particularly useful if you are using the dfx canister sign and dfx canister send commands to call the ledger or governance canister to make a transaction or stake tokens as a two-step process. There are new deposit_cycles and uninstall_code management canister methods that are also exposed as dfx canister subcommands. The two new commands are dfx canister deposit-cycles and dfx canister uninstall-code. For example, you can now send cycles from your cycles wallet to a specific canister by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister deposit-cycles 125000000000 hello_world You can uninstall code for a deployed WASM module by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister uninstall-code hello_world A new --no-artificial-delay option enables you to reduce the time it takes for the local 互联网计算机 to start. This change adds the --no-artificial-delay flag to dfx start and dfx replica commands. By default, the local 互联网计算机 replica that is installed with the DFINITY Canister SDK has an artificial consensus delay to simulate the delay users might see in a networked environment. With this new flag, you can skip the built-in delay when you start the local 互联网计算机 by running either the dfx start --no-artificial-delay or dfx replica --no-artificial-delay command. For example, you can start the local 互联网计算机 without a delay by running the following command: dfx start -no-artificial-delay If you use this option, however, you might an increase in the CPU used by the local 互联网计算机 replica. The DFINITY Canister SDK version 0.7.1 introduces a change to the default principal used when you run dfx canister call commands. Depending on the version of the DFINITY Canister SDK that you were previously using, this change might require changes to your program code or to the way you call methods in deployed canisters. The cycles wallet canister identifier is not longer used as the message caller by default. In some previous versions of the DFINITY Canister SDK, the dfx canister call command would use the cycles wallet canister identifier as the message caller to perform queries and update calls by default. The --no-wallet command-line option was introduced to allow you to bypass the cycles wallet canister identifier and perform query and update calls using the currently-selected identity. However, using the cycles wallet canister identifier to execute dfx canister call commands resulted in each call being treated as an inter-canister call and the calls would take longer than necessary to resolve. With this release, dfx canister call commands no longer use the cycles wallet canister identifier to execute query and update calls by default. If you want to execute a query or update call using the cycles wallet, you can run a command similar to the following: dfx canister --wallet=cycles-wallet-id call canister method This section covers any reported issues that have been fixed in this release. Allow consistent use of canisters names or identifiers in dfx canister commands. Previously, dfx canister commands were inconsistent about whether you could specify a canister using a canister name or a canister identifier. With this change, all dfx canister commands now accept either a canister name as specified in the local dfx.json configuration file or a valid canister identifier as listed in the canister_ids.json file.","title":"Highlights of what’s new in 0.7.1","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"0.7.1-rn","url":"/docs/release-notes/0.7.1-rn.html","titles":[{"text":"New features and capabilities","id":"_new_features_and_capabilities"},{"text":"Breaking change","id":"_breaking_change"},{"text":"Issues fixed in this release","id":"_issues_fixed_in_this_release"}]},"/docs/release-notes/0.7.2-rn.html":{"text":"The 0.7.2 release includes updates and fixes that are primarily internal to improve existing features and functions rather than user-visible.

If you have an existing project that depends on dfx-generated frontend files, you may need to make some adjustments when upgrading to 0.8.0. Depending on your situation you may want to choose to set up environment variables or to make a minimum set of changes. We will document both cases here. With webpack, we are providing environment variables by using an EnvironmentPlugin. At the top of webpack.config.js, we read from the root canister_ids.json and the one inside .dfx/local to map the canister IDs into environment variables, and then replace the process.env values in the code during development or at build time. // webpack.config.js let localCanisters, prodCanisters, canisters; try { localCanisters = require(path.resolve(\".dfx\", \"local\", \"canister_ids.json\")); } catch (error) { console.log(\"No local canister_ids.json found.

The output no longer hardcodes the canister ids into JavaScript, so you will need to provide that code using your own strategy. Other bundlers that allow for custom scripting should be able to re-use the webpack config logic. Determining NODE_ENV. During development, the app should call agent.fetchRootKey(), but it should not fetch the root key in production. Copying the codegen, as we do in the dfx new template, is optional. You still have access to the .did.js and .did.d.ts files in .dfx, so you can choose to ignore the new index.js format if it is inconvenient, and continue providing your own Actor.createActor pattern as before. Return types - if you do not want to use the dfx-provided files, consider using the JSDoc comments that we have come up with. If the code knows that your actor has a type of ActorSubclass, for your particular service, the development process is significantly enhanced in compatible editors. If you are looking to minimally modify your project, here is all you need to do, assuming you are starting from the 0.7.2 starter: You can continue using a query parameter in your URL, you can access it via // src/example_assets/src/index.js import { idlFactory as example_idl } from 'dfx-generated/example/example.did.js'; import canisterIds from '../../../.dfx/local/canister_ids.json' const example_id = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(\"exampleId\") || canisterIds.example.local; const agent = new HttpAgent(); agent.fetchRootKey(); const example = Actor.createActor(example_idl, { agent, canisterId: example_id }); And you can modify the aliases reducer to point to the path, rather than hardcoding the old .js file // webpack.config.js // Old [\"dfx-generated/\" + name]: path.join(outputRoot, name + \".js\"), // New [\"dfx-generated/\" + name]: path.join(outputRoot), Then, you can dfx deploy like normal and visit your working site with http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai&exampleId=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai.","title":"Highlights of what’s new in 0.8.0","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"0.8.0-rn","url":"/docs/release-notes/0.8.0-rn.html","titles":[{"text":"Instructions on migrating to dfx 0.8.0","id":"_instructions_on_migrating_to_dfx_0_8_0"},{"text":"Environment variables","id":"_environment_variables"},{"text":"Minimal Update","id":"_minimal_update"}]},"/docs/release-notes/0.8.1-rn.html":{"text":"An overview of the 0.8.1 release: Adds a dfx generate command to generate types for code editors.

If you have made the choice to control your digital assets yourself, you should be aware that there are different kinds of self-custody solutions and that those solutions vary in their security and ease of use. Before you decide on a specific self-custody solution, you should spend some time learning about the various options available and how they differ. This guide provides a brief introduction to the concept of cold storage as part of your custody strategy and the most common types of cold storage currently available. For additional information about cold storage and other custody options, you should do your own research and be sure that you understand the ramifications of your choices thoroughly before proceeding. Cold storage means that you are keeping private keys stored offline in a device that is not connected to the internet. Cold storage is a popular solution for self-custody of digital assets because it makes it more difficult for your keys to be compromised if there is a software security breach or if your cold storage solution is lost or stolen. For more information about approaches to cold storage and best practices for securing your private keys, see the following additional resources: Cold storage Best Practices when using a Hardware Wallet 10 Rules for the Secure Use of Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallets The most common types of cold storage include the following: Hardware wallets Air-gapped computers Paper wallets A hardware wallet is a physical device that holds your digital assets. Private keys are stored in a secure part of the device that does not come into contact with the internet. The partitioned storage on the physical device reduces the risks that are associated with devices connected to the internet. Because you are relying on a physical device, however, losing the device also means losing access to your digital assets. In most cases, you can recover from the loss of a hardware wallet because the assets stored on hardware wallets are secured using a secret seed phrase. . If you copy and secure the seed phrase—for example, by storing it in the form of a paper wallet—you can initialize a new device with the seed phrase and regain access to your digital assets. For more information, see Crypto Wallets, Explained. An air-gapped computer is isolated from insecure networks that interact with the internet or unsecured local area networks in your home. Converting a standard personal computer or similar device into an air-gapped computer might require you to physically remove network cards, disable certain software, or be prepared to completely wipe the machine before connecting it to the internet again. Depending on how secure you want your air-gapped computer to be, one option is to use a bootable image that provides a minimal operating system to collect your digital assets then remove any artifacts from that process and reboot the computer normally after completing any transaction. For more information, see Extreme Security Measures for the Extra Paranoid and The Ultimate Defense: What Is an Air Gapped Computer?. A paper wallet is a piece of printed paper that contains your important key information (in some cases, even a QR code) and is used for facilitating digital asset transactions. Paper wallets are often not recommended because they are susceptible to degradation and could be insecure or lost or stolen easily. As a backup to a hardware wallet, however, you might want to create a paper wallet and store it in a secure location such as a safe deposit box. For more information, see Paper wallets. It is ultimately your responsibility to research the cold storage and custody solutions available to you. Regardless of the type of self-custody solution you select, it is also your responsibility to keep your digital assets safe. With this in mind, you should take note of the following general recommendations: Do not use a work computer to configure a digital asset storage solution. Your private personal data could be lost or compromised while hosted on a work computer, especially if that computer is routinely connected to the internet.

The NNS controls all aspects of the 互联网计算机 blockchain configuration and is responsible for performing many network management operations. For example, the Network Nervous System (NNS) is responsible for: Upgrading the protocol and guest operating system software used by the nodes that provide computing capacity to the network. Inducting new node operators and machines into the network. Creating new subnets to increase network capacity. Splitting subnets to balance network load. Configuring parameters that control how much must be paid by users for compute capacity. Monitoring canister activity and node performance for malicious behavior and statistical deviations. De-activating malicious software or under-performing nodes to protect the network. The requests for changes and updates to the network are submitted to the NNS in the form of proposals. The NNS decides to adopt or reject proposals based on voting activity by neuron holders. For network participants to be able to vote on proposals, they need to lock up a stake of ICP utility tokens for a given period of time to create a representative called a neuron. Because neurons represent a stake of ICP utility tokens, they also represent an identity with a ledger canister account and a principal that controls the ledger account. Neurons provide the stability required for responsible governance of the 互联网计算机 by ensuring that the ICP utility tokens they represent cannot be exchanged for a specific period of time referred to as the lock-up period. The following diagram provides a simplified view of the workflow for creating a neuron and the relationship between the neuron and ledger canisters. When a person or organization has ICP utility tokens locked up in a neuron, the neuron holder can propose and vote on governance issues. To encourage participation, neuron holders are also rewarded for voting in proportion to the number of ICP utility tokens they have locked up and the length of the lock-up period up to a maximum of eight years. After network participants create a neuron, the locked balance of ICP utility tokens can only be unlocked by fully dissolving the neuron. In its locked state, the neuron has a fixed non-zero dissolve delay equivalent to the lock-up period. For example, assume you have a stake of 100 ICP utility tokens locked up for a period of five years. After successfully created the neuron with these settings, your dissolve delay is five years. Based on the dissolve delay that decreases as time progresses, a dissolve timer determines how long it will take to completely dissolve a neuron. When the dissolve timer reaches zero, the neuron owner—the ICP utility token holder who created the neuron, or an authenticated custodian, can dissolve the neuron and unlock the balance of ICP utility tokens. The dissolved neuron ceases to exist and the stake of ICP utility tokens that the neuron represented is released to the appropriate ledger canister account. To connect to the 互联网计算机 using the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp: Open a browser and navigate to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Login to connect to Internet Identity. If you haven’t previously registered, you can click Register with Internet Identity to register. We strongly recommend you add multiple devices and authentication methods to your Internet Identity. For example, register multiple physical devices like your computer and phone with a security key and using the authentication options that those devices—and browsers running on them—support. For more information about creating an Internet Identity, see How to use Internet Identity. After you have registered, you can click Login to authenticate using your anchor and the authentication method—for example, a security key or fingerprint—you have registered. Click Proceed to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Logging on using an Internet Identity creates a Main account for you in the 互联网计算机 ledger. If your ICP utility tokens are associated with your developer identity; that is, the identity created by the DFINITY Canister SDK dfx command-line interface. Your Main account displays 0.00 for your ICP utility token balance. For example: Before transferring any tokens, you can create one or more linked subaccounts or attach a hardware wallet to your account. To add an account for managing ICP utility tokens: Open a browser and navigate to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Login to connect using your Internet Identity. Verify your identification number, then click Login to authenticate using the device and authentication method you have registered. Click Proceed to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. On the default ICP tab, click Add Account. Select the type of account to add. New Linked Account creates a new subaccount linked to your Main account address in the ledger. Attach Hardware Wallet adds a hardware wallet to your main account address in the ledger. Click New Linked Account, type an Account Name, then click Create. If you have selected self-custody for holding your ICP utility tokens and the tokens are associated with your developer identity instead of your registered Internet Identity, you need to transfer ICP utility tokens to your accounts if you want to manage them using the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. To transfer ICP utility tokens controlled by your developer identity: Open a terminal shell on your local computer. Check that you are using an identity with control over the ledger account by running the following command: dfx identity whoami In most cases, you should see that you are currently using your default developer identity. For example: default View the textual representation of the principal for your current identity by running the following command: dfx identity get-principal This command displays output similar to the following: tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe Check the current balance in the ledger account associated with your identity by running the following command: dfx ledger --network ic balance Transfer ICP utility tokens to your Main account or a linked subaccount you create by running a command similar to the following: dfx ledger --network ic transfer --icp --memo For example, assume you have the following accounts: If you want to transfer one ICP utility token to the Main account, you can run the following command: dfx ledger --network ic transfer dd81336dbfef5c5870e84b48405c7b229c07ad999fdcacb85b9b9850bd60766f --memo 12345 --icp 1 If you also want to transfer one ICP utility token to the pubs account, you can run the following command: dfx ledger --network ic transfer 183a04888eb20e73766f082bae01587830bd3cd912544f63fda515e9d77a96dc --icp 1 --memo 12346 This example illustrates how to transfer ICP utility tokens to using a whole number with the --icp command-line option. You can also specify fractional units of ICP utility tokens—called e8s—using the --e8s option, either on its own or in conjunction with the --icp option. Alternatively, you can use the --amount to specify the number of ICP utility tokens to transfer with fractional units up to 8 decimal places, for example, as 5.00000025. The destination address can be an address in the ledger canister running on the 互联网计算机 network, an account you have added using the Network Nervous System dapp, or the address for a wallet you have on an exchange. If you transfer the ICP utility tokens to an account in the Network Nervous System dapp, you might need to refresh the browser to see the transaction reflected. For more information about using the dfx ledger command-line options, see dfx ledger. After you transfer ICP utility tokens to the Network Nervous System dapp, you can use the Network Nervous System dapp to create and manage neurons, vote on proposals, and create canisters on the 互联网计算机. Neurons are required to participate in governance and earn rewards. To create a neuron, you must lock up some number of ICP utility tokens for a period of time. The minimum stake required to create a neuron is one ICP utility token. You can configure the period of time the stake is locked from six months up to a maximum of eight years. To stake ICP utility tokens: Open a browser and navigate to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Login to connect using your Internet Identity. Verify your identification number, then click Login to authenticate using the device and authentication method you have registered. Click Proceed to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Neurons, then click Stake Neuron. Type the number of ICP utility tokens to stake, then click Create. Set the dissolve delay for the neuron to control the length of time the stake is locked, then click Update Delay. For example: Click Yes, I’m sure to confirm the lock up period, then close the window to review the newly-created neuron properties. After you have locked the stake and created a neuron, you can: Start the dissolve delay timer by clicking Start Unlock. Increase the dissolve delay period by clicking Increase Dissolve Delay. Stop the dissolve delay after starting the unlock countdown by clicking Lockup. Increase the number of ICP utility tokens you have staked. Creating a new neuron does not automatically start the dissolve delay timer. You must explicitly start the timer countdown by clicking Start Unlock. For example, if you set a dissolve delay of one year and want to immediately begin the countdown, you should click Start Unlock as part of the process of creating the neuron. If you change your mind and want to stop a current countdown in progress, you can click Lockup, After you click Lockup to stop the dissolve delay, you can click Start Unlock to resume the countdown without changing the existing dissolve delay period. If you want to continue a countdown already in progress but extend the lock up period, you can click Increase Dissolve Delay then select a longer dissolve delay. After you create a neuron, you can increase the number of ICP utility tokens you have staked in that neuron to increase your voting power and rewards. For example, if you initially stake a small number of ICP utility tokens, then decide to purchase additional tokens, you have the option to create a new neuron or \"top-up\" your existing neuron. To increase the stake in an existing neuron: Follow the steps in Stake ICP utility tokens in a neuron to stake the original neuron using the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Look up the transaction in the 互联网计算机 Association transaction dashboard to get the neuron address. You can use the account identifier for your main ICP ledger account to search for your transactions. Return to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp, then click New Transaction. Paste the neuron address from the transaction dashboard into the Destination address field, then click Continue. Type the amount of ICP utility tokens you want to add to the specified neuron, then click Continue. Verify the transaction details, then click Confirm and Send. Verify the completed transaction, then click Close. Click the Neurons tab to see the increased stake. Active participation in governance is an important factor in the long-term health of the 互联网计算机. Voting on proposals is also an important factor in calculating the rewards you receive in return for locking up ICP utility tokens in neurons. However, voting directly on every proposal submitted to the NNS presents several challenges. For example, proposals might be submitted and require a vote when you are unavailable or propose changes that you lack the expertise to evaluate. To address these challenges, you can configure neurons to vote automatically to adopt or reject proposals by following the votes of a group of neurons. To maximize your rewards, you should vote on as many proposals as possible by following the active neuron holders who have interests aligned with your own. For example, you might follow the Internet Computer Association (ICA) on some topics such SubnetManagement and other neuron holders on topics such as Governance. To configure how you follow other neuron holders: Open a browser and navigate to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Login to connect using your Internet Identity. Verify your identification number, then click Login to authenticate using the device and authentication method you have registered. Click Proceed to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Neurons, then click the link for a specific neuron identifier to display its properties. Click Edit Followees. Choose a proposal topic. For example, expand the Governance topic, then click Enter Followee. Select a neuron holder to follow, then click Follow. For example, click Follow for the Internet Computer Association. The neuron holder is added to you Currently Following list. Repeat for each topic where you want your neuron’s votes to automatically follow the votes of one or more other neuron holders. When the dissolve delay timer for a neuron reaches zero, you can disburse the neuron’s stake and transfer its locked ICP utility token balance to the ledger account you specify. After you take this step, the neuron identifier and its ledger history are permanently removed from the governance canister. To disburse a neuron and return its ICP utility tokens: Open a browser and navigate to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Login to connect using your Internet Identity. Verify your identification number, then click Login to authenticate using the device and authentication method you have registered. Click Proceed to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Neurons, then click Unlocked neuron that has reach the ended of its dissolve delay period. For example: Click Disburse. For example: Type an address or select an account to receive the ICP utility tokens. For example, you might select the dev-projects linked account: Verify the transaction information, then click Confirm and Send. For example, check that the Destination address matches the intended address of the dev-projects linked account: Verify the completed transaction, then click Close. For example: If you transferred the ICP utility tokens to one of your accounts in the 互联网计算机 ledger canister, you can click the ICP tab and see your new balance reflected. For example: As you vote on proposals—either directly or by following the votes of other neurons—the maturity associated with your neuron increases, which in turn increases the rewards you earn for participating in governance. When the maturity for a locked stake reaches a minimum threshold of one ICP, you can spawn a new neuron. The spawn operation creates a new neuron that locks a new balance of ICP on the ledger. For example, if you have a neuron that contains 100 ICP utility tokens and it has a maturity of 10 percent, you can spawn a new neuron that contains approximately 10 new ICP tokens. For the neuron with 100 ICP tokens to reach the minimum threshold for spawning, its maturity would need to be greater than one percent. After you spawn a new neuron from an existing neuron, the maturity for the existing neuron falls to zero. To spawn new neurons from an existing neuron: Open a browser and navigate to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Login to connect using your Internet Identity. Verify your identification number, then click Login to authenticate using the device and authentication method you have registered. Click Proceed to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Neurons, then click the neuron that has reached the minimum maturity required to spawn a new neuron. Click Spawn Neuron. Keep in mind that the dissolve delay for a newly-spawned neurons is one day, giving you the option to collect value from the ICP utility tokens by unlocking them or to increase the dissolve delay to collect additional rewards. For more information about maturity and spawning new neurons, see the following articles: Earn Substantial Voting Rewards by Staking in the Network Nervous System Understanding the Internet Computer’s Network Nervous System, Neurons, and ICP Utility Tokens Getting Started on the Internet Computer’s Network Nervous System App & Wallet You can choose the proposal types and proposal topics that you see and vote on—either directly or by following other neuron stakeholders—using filters in the Network Nervous System dapp. For example, if you want to review and vote on all proposals that involve network participants such as data center identities and node operators, but aren’t interested in viewing proposals related to the current market value of ICP, as measured by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Drawing Right (SDR), you can select the ParticipantManagement topic filter and deselect the ExchangeRate topic filter. To manually vote on proposals: Open a browser and navigate to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Login to connect using your Internet Identity. Verify your identification number, then click Login to authenticate using the device and authentication method you have registered. Click Proceed to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Voting. You can click any of the proposals listed to view information about the proposal, including a brief description of the proposal, a link for viewing additional information about the proposal, the number of votes that were cast to adopt or reject the proposal, and the votes cast by your neurons. Use the Topics, Reward Status, and Proposal Status filters to control the list of proposals displayed. For example, open the Topics list to see if there are any proposal topics that you want to include in the proposal list that are not currently displayed and open the Proposal Status to verify that you are viewing all open proposals. Click any Open proposal to see its details and the voting power for the neurons associated with your identity. Select the neuron identifiers with voting power that you want to use to cast your vote. Click Adopt or Reject to cast your vote. For more information about voting and voting rewards, see the following articles: Earn Substantial Voting Rewards by Staking in the Network Nervous System Understanding the Internet Computer’s Network Nervous System, Neurons, and ICP Utility Tokens Getting Started on the Internet Computer’s Network Nervous System App & Wallet Currently, you can only submit proposals to the network nervous system by using the DFINITY Canister SDK command-line interface (dfx) using calls to the governance canister. A separate command-line tool (icx-nns) for working with the governance canister is in development and this functionality will also be available in the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp soon. If you want to start submitting proposals right away, however, you can access a preliminary version of the icx-nns command-line tool by downloading a release from the icx-nns repository. For information about how to download the icx-nns command-line tool and how to use it to submit proposals, see How to submit proposals to the Network Nervous System. You must have cycles available to create and manage canisters, which are similar to smart contracts. The Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp provides a convenient way for you to create and manage canisters by enabling you to convert ICP utility tokens into cycles and attach cycles to specific canister identifiers. To create a new canister: Open a browser and navigate to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Login to connect using your Internet Identity. Verify your identification number, then click Login to authenticate using the device and authentication method you have registered. Click Proceed to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Click Canisters, then click Create or Link Canister. Click Create New Canister to create a new cycles wallet canister. If you already have a cycles wallet canister, you can click Link Canister to Account to link an existing canister identifier to your account in the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp. Select one of your accounts that holds ICP utility tokens as the source account. For example, if you have both a Main account and a Dev-Projects account, you might select Dev-Projects account if that account holds the ICP utility tokens that you want converted into cycles. Click Amount and type the number of ICP utility tokens or e8s that you want to convert into cycles, then click Review Cycles Purchase. The amount you specify must convert to a value greater than the 2T (two trillion) cycles minimum required to create a new canister identifier. For example: Review the ICP utility tokens to cycles details, then click Confirm to continue. After you click Confirm, you can review: - the new canister identifier - the number of cycles available for the canister to use - the controlling principal that currently has full management rights for the new canister + To change the principal used as the controller of the canister, click Change Controllers. + To add cycles to the canister, click Add Cycles. Return to the Canisters tab to see the canisters you have created.

You have been granted ICP at a rate of 30 tokens per Swiss Franc of value donated in 2017, which Genesis Unlock is disbursing in the form of a basket of 49 voting neurons. These neurons already exist inside the Network Nervous System, the completely open, tokenized governance system that controls the Internet Computer blockchain network. Your neurons contain the ICP you have been awarded, staked inside. Your neurons have been configured to vote automatically and are already earning voting rewards for you. You do not need to do anything to initialize your neurons in order to continue earning voting rewards. A neuron is like a savings account where you must provide notice of withdrawals. The configured notice period is called the “dissolve delay”. You can start and stop dissolving a neuron at any time. The greater the dissolve delay, the greater the neuron’s voting power, and the greater the voting rewards it receives. We are pleased to inform you that your neurons have been pre-aged! At the moment of Genesis Unlock, their age was already set to 18 months old. This is important, because neuron age significantly increases your voting power and the voting rewards you receive. When you start dissolving a neuron, the blockchain will reset its age to zero immediately. Therefore, be very careful to only begin dissolving neurons when you wish to unstake the ICP inside. Genesis Unlock created 49 neurons for you. They have dissolve delays of 0 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and so on. Apart from the first neuron which has a dissolve delay of 0 days (which can be dissolved immediately), the other dissolve delays may have a small random number of days either added or removed. To configure one of your neurons, for example to change how it votes, or to place it into dissolving mode, follow these steps: This process is not currently possible on macOS computers with M1 chips. You can only install the DFINITY Canister SDK dfx and the Candid compiler didc on Intel-based macOS and Linux computers. Derive a native Internet Computer principal from your Ethereum seed Take control of your neurons Enable disbursal by passing the KYC process Instruct the neurons you wish to unstake to dissolve Disburse ICP from neurons that are fully dissolved As an early contributor or seed donor, you wrote down a 12-word mnemonic seed phrase that was generated by the DFINITY Chrome extension. To create an identity, you must derive a private key from your seed phrase and import that private key into the DFINITY Canister SDK. This step is required before you can Take control of your neurons. The safety and security of your private key is your responsibility and there is no substitute for planning ahead, bringing the right equipment, having the right skills, and using good judgment. We strongly recommend you proceed using an air-gapped computer to reduce the risk of having your private key compromised. Depending on the hardware available, you might want to physically remove your network controller, microphone, speakers, and other components, or disable them in your BIOS. Covert channels can be established through a variety of different mediums, including sound, light, radio-frequency, and physical media. Be sure to evaluate the capabilities of your system before settling on a configuration that makes sense for you. If you don’t know what you are doing, you should consult with a computer security expert. Do not contact the DFINITY Foundation for help with securing your environment. You need Keysmith to derive your private/public key pair from you seed phrase. To install Keysmith, you must either Fetch the release binary or Build Keysmith from source. If you want to download the Keysmith release binary, keep in mind that you must perform this action on a computer with a network connection. If you are using an air-gapped computer, then you must copy the release binary from your networked computer to your air-gapped computer. How you do this will depend on your configuration. To download the Keysmith release binary, fetch release v1.5.0 from Github. Keysmith supports the following operating systems and architectures: Darwin / AMD64 – for macOS models with an Intel chip (how to check) Darwin / ARM64 – for newer macOS models with an M1 chip (how to check) Linux / AMD64 Linux / ARM32 Linux / ARM64 Windows / AMD64 Download the .tar.gz file matching your architecture and operating system. If you have a newer M1-based macOS, download keysmith-darwin-arm64.tar.gz. Although you can install keysmith on macOS computers with an M1 chip, you can only install the DFINITY Canister SDK dfx command-line interface on Intel-based macOS computers. For an Intel-based macOS, download keysmith-darwin-amd64.tar.gz. Open a terminal and change to the download directory. On a Mac this is cd ~/Downloads Compute the SHA256 checksum of your download. openssl dgst -sha256 keysmith-*.tar* Make sure the output matches one of the following lines: SHA256(keysmith-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)= ad7383d60bced19580fa37b77e133b1e80416b482e4c5326ac2fd17a7710a318 SHA256(keysmith-darwin-arm64.tar.gz)= da1a4ac5ae04b85d4c5b0a3deb6442fb7c456dcf97cbd6ff8153316c5dbb29a9 SHA256(keysmith-linux-amd64.tar.gz)= 7901c3a23aef298f930d1dddf8eee23bc51a55ffda670accfd7b9e37748913d8 SHA256(keysmith-linux-arm32.tar.gz)= 0ab44e74cc502aa653dcb28962bcada5cbefb9e0ec41853a03fb4745c5cd51a9 SHA256(keysmith-linux-arm64.tar.gz)= 635c0bf98dd15f27b302ec0ea793f75c797441009c74500bd9d0a5df26092264 SHA256(keysmith-windows-amd64.tar.gz)= cb398c39583b81d5170dd0a9539d902715317572f6a640b45d3d2db01946b8fa If your browser already unzipped the .tar.gz for you and you have a file ending in .tar then make sure the output of openssl matches one of the following lines: SHA256(keysmith-darwin-amd64.tar)= 97b8048f00e75d6adc8651aac1aa77d9bd9c150b0dbc0b0f6409f0d6bdbb24a4 SHA256(keysmith-darwin-arm64.tar)= 07e296fbf33b0c06bd04a8ead30487762aa30ca2daf7e19948d74a96f2c34067 SHA256(keysmith-linux-amd64.tar)= 1d2d986a971f8c7ef0eeb4b01624f023ef8dc9c71d2f0127f21fcc99aebdc99a SHA256(keysmith-linux-arm32.tar)= 8eb8efecd9182822326f2e60fcff32c0b1541cce206a12b3f2e94547c66dfe63 SHA256(keysmith-linux-arm64.tar)= 82264487e83cbfdd758c1227375758b7d1f0c864adb555775777e7d3afa19e08 SHA256(keysmith-windows-amd64.tar)= b85224d4e9807b8335295193c12dd0cab22bd38881d14c1f1c21479801ace17d To extract the executable from the tarball, enter the following command into your terminal: tar -f keysmith-*.tar* -x Next, add the executable to your PATH by entering the commands below: sudo install -d /usr/local/bin sudo install keysmith /usr/local/bin You will be prompted to enter your laptop password. The password itself will not appear, simply type it and press enter. keysmith You should see: usage: keysmith [] Available Commands: account Print your account identifier. generate Generate your mnemonic seed. legacy-address Print your legacy address. principal Print your principal identifier. private-key Write your private key to a file. public-key Print your public key. version Print the version number. x-public-key Print your extended public key. If you are using macOS, making the keysmith binary executable might require you to change a permission setting using System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General. If you want to build the Keysmith from source, keep in mind that you must perform this action on a computer with a network connection. If you are using an air-gapped computer, then you must copy the target binary from your networked computer to your air-gapped computer. How you do this will depend on your configuration. Keysmith is written in Go, so if you choose to build it from source, then you must first download and install Go, verify that go is in your PATH, and configure your GOPATH and GOBIN environment variables. Run the following command to build Keysmith from source. go get github.com/dfinity/keysmith You can install the DFINITY Canister SDK by fetching the v0.7.0 release binary from our website. It is not yet possible to build the DFINITY Canister SDK from source. Note that this action can only be performed on a networked computer. If you are using an air-gapped computer, then you must copy the release binary from your networked computer to your air-gapped computer. How you do this will depend on your configuration. Run the following command to install the DFINITY Canister SDK. sh -ci \"$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)\" Warning: Note that dfx will currently not install on M1-based Macs. Once you have installed Keysmith and the DFINITY Canister SDK, and you are confident that your environment is secure, then you are ready to enter your seed for use with keysmith. For the duration of your session, you store your seed phrase in an environment variable. It will be eliminated from your system when you turn your computer off. read seed Enter your seed phrase and finish with Return. If you prefer to not have your seed phrase displayed as you type then use this command instead: read -s seed At this point you can already verify your legacy address and ICPT balance. The legacy address matches to what was formerly called \"DFN address\" in the Dfinity Chrome extension. You may have copied it from the Chrome extension for your records back when you used the extension. echo $seed | keysmith legacy-address -f - The output is a 40 character hex string. It looks something like this: 2d89d96b10f7a9456a9154b2f5309ee70df5bce1 You can check your ICPT balance as follows: echo {} > dfx.json GTC=renrk-eyaaa-aaaaa-aaada-cai ADDR=$(echo $seed | keysmith legacy-address -f -) dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $GTC balance '(\"'$ADDR'\")' The output is the number of ICPT associated with your address. If you are an early contributor then you may have multiple addresses, all derived from your one seed phrase. To check the balance in each of them you do the following commands: GTC=renrk-eyaaa-aaaaa-aaada-cai ADDR=$(echo $seed | keysmith legacy-address -f - -i 0) dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $GTC balance '(\"'$ADDR'\")' Then you repeat the last two lines with -i 1, -i 2, etc. Derive your private key from your seed phrase. echo $seed | keysmith private-key -f - This creates a file identity.pem containing your private key. Import your private key(s) into the DFINITY Canister SDK and then remove it from the filesystem. dfx identity import identity.pem rm identity.pem Here, is an alias that you can choose arbitrarily for your identity, e.g. \"jane\". The command above displays output similar to the following: Creating identity: \"jane\". Created identity: \"jane\". Make your new identity the currently-active one. dfx identity use The command above displays output similar to the following: Using identity: \"jane\". At any time, you can list all available identities with dfx identity list You will receive your tokens inside a set of neurons that have been pre-created for you. The number of neurons will total 31 or 49 depending on whether you are an early contributor or seed donor, respectively. Your tokens are disbursed equally over these neurons. Claiming your neurons is the process of obtaining control over your neurons. It is done for all neurons at once. Your neurons differ by their dissolve delay. For an explanation of dissolve delay see Instruct the neurons you wish to unstake to dissolve below. To claim your neurons, you need to sign and send a message to the Genesis Token Canister. You can accomplish this in one step on a networked computer using dfx canister call, or as two separate steps, one on an air-gapped computer using dfx canister sign, and another on a networked computer using dfx canister send. We strongly recommend the latter approach to reduce the risk of having your private key compromised. Regardless of which method you choose, you will need to download and install didc, the Candid compiler, on your networked computer. You can find the latest release here. Note that the binaries are suffixed by the operating systems they run on, didc-linux64 and didc-macos. Be sure to download the correct one. Below are commands to install didc on macos. If your’re using Linux, simply use the linux64 suffix instead. sudo install -d /usr/local/bin sudo install -m 0755 ~/Downloads/didc-macos /usr/local/bin/didc Regardless of which method you choose, you will also need to download and extract the NNS canister interfaces on your networked computer. You can find the latest release here. Below are commands to extract the NNS canister interfaces. pushd ~/Downloads tar -f nns-ifaces-0.8.0.tar.gz -x popd Additionally, you will need to have dfx.json file available in the directory from which you are running dfx commands. You can create an empty dfx.json file in your current directory by running the following command. echo {} > dfx.json Note that if you’re using an air-gapped computer, then you’ll need to repeat this step since you’ll be running dfx commands in both places. After downloading and installing didc, downloading and extracting the NNS canister interfaces, and creating your dfx.json file(s), you can Claim in one step (not recommended) or Claim in two steps. Verify that you can connect to the Internet Computer. dfx ping https://ic0.app Derive your public key. PUBLIC_KEY=\"$(echo $seed | keysmith public-key -f -)\" Call the Genesis Token Canister to claim your neurons.

PUBLIC_KEY=\"$(echo $seed | keysmith public-key -f -)\" Sign a message to claim your neurons. Note that the time allotted to send a signed message is a fixed 5-minute window. The --expire-after option enables you to specify the point in time when the 5-minute window for sending the signed message should end. For example, if you set the --expire-after option to one hour (1h), then you must wait at least 55 minutes before you send the generated message and the signature for the message is only valid during the 5-minute window ending in the 60th minute. Hence, you would need to send the message after 55 minutes and before 60 minutes for the message to be recognized as valid. If you don’t specify the --expire-after option, then the default expiration is five minutes. CANISTER=renrk-eyaaa-aaaaa-aaada-cai dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet sign --expire-after=1h $CANISTER claim_neurons '(\"'$PUBLIC_KEY'\")' The command above results in a message.json file in your current directory. You must copy that file from your air-gapped computer to your networked computer. How you do this will depend on your configuration. Verify that you can connect to the Internet Computer. dfx ping https://ic0.app Send the signed message to the Genesis Token Canister to claim your neurons. As previously mentioned, you can only perform this action within the 5-minute window that you specified. dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet send message.json Unlike dfx canister call in the section [Claim in one step], the command dfx canister send does not return output that can be parsed by didc. Instead, it outputs only a request id. In order to see the effect of your send request, you have to do an additional step. Perform the following commands on your networked machine: CANISTER=renrk-eyaaa-aaaaa-aaada-cai RESULT=\"$(dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER get_account '(\"paste legacy address here\")' --output=raw)\" didc decode -t \"(Result_2)\" -d ~/Downloads/nns-ifaces-0.8.0/genesis_token.did $RESULT The legacy address to paste here in the second line above is what was formerly called \"DFN address\" in the Chrome extension. Note that the legacy address must be pasted without the 0x prefix and without the 8-character checksum at the end, i.e. it has exactly 40 characters in length. Furthermore, the legacy address must be in all lowercase. If you don’t remember it then you can obtain your legacy address by running this on your air-gapped machine: echo $seed | keysmith legacy-address -f - What you want to look for in the output of the get_account request is has_claimed = true and your principal. For example, the output of the get_account command looks like this for an unclaimed account: ( variant { Ok = record { authenticated_principal_id = null; successfully_transferred_neurons = vec {}; has_donated = false; failed_transferred_neurons = vec {}; neuron_ids = vec { record { id = 1_234_567_890_123_456_789 : nat64;}; ... }; has_claimed = false; has_forwarded = false; icpts = 12345 : nat32; } }, ) And like this for a successfully claimed account: ( variant { Ok = record { authenticated_principal_id = opt principal \"a56gn-wnhrl-i76df-ewgfe-23jfd-dfh03-ergrg-fesr1-1jhs9-reg2o-ure\"; successfully_transferred_neurons = vec {}; has_donated = false; failed_transferred_neurons = vec {}; neuron_ids = vec { record { id = 1_234_567_890_123_456_789 : nat64;}; ... }; has_claimed = true; has_forwarded = false; icpts = 12345 : nat32; } }, ) After you have claimed your neurons (in one step or two) you should look at your neuron identifier and keep them handy for the future. You will need to reference them when you Instruct the neurons you wish to unstake to dissolve. You can see your neuron identifiers in the output of the get_account of which you saw an example just above. The neuron identifiers are the numbers that look like this: 1_234_567_890_123_456_789. You could just copy paste them from the output of get_account. A better alternative is to extract the neuron identifiers more conveniently into an one-per-line output as follows. On your networked computer do: ADDR=\"write your legacy address here\" GTC=renrk-eyaaa-aaaaa-aaada-cai dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $GTC get_account '(\"'$ADDR'\")' | grep 2_024_218_412 | awk '$1=$1' RS=\";\" | grep = | sed -e 's/.*= //' The result should be a list of 31 or 49 neuron identifiers. If you are not in an airgapped setup you can do ADDR=$(echo $seed | keysmith legacy-address -f -) and don’t have to type your legacy address. You can query individual neurons to learn more about them such as the dissolve delay, its age, its voting power, its state (locked, dissolving, dissolved). To do that, issue the following commands on your networked computer. Substitute …​ by the identifier of the neuron you are querying. These commands query the governance canister. NEURON_ID=... CANISTER=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai RESULT=\"$(dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER get_neuron_info \"($NEURON_ID:nat64)\" --output=raw)\" didc decode -t \"(Result_2)\" -d ~/Downloads/nns-ifaces-0.8.0/governance.did $RESULT Before you can disburse ICPT from your dissolved genesis neuron you must pass KYC. Note that this applies only to genesis neurons such as the ones given to seed donors. It does not apply to neurons that you later create by staking already-liquid ICPT. The DFINITY Chrome extension generated a 12-word mnemonic seed phrase. From that seed phrase, an Ethereum-style address can be derived, which was referred to in the Chrome extension as the \"DFN address\". The KYC process requires that you submit your DFN address along with other information. The easiest way to obtain your DFN address is to derive it from your seed phrase using Keysmith. The section Derive a native Internet Computer principal from your Ethereum seed already explained how to set up Keysmith and write your seed phrase into a file in a safe way. We assume here that you have carried out the steps at least up until that point. It is not important whether you have carried out any of the remaining steps on the way to claim your neurons. It is also not important whether you have installed the DFINITY Canister SDK. You only need Keysmith. Derive your DFN address. echo $seed | keysmith legacy-address -f - The command above displays output similar to a typical Ethereum address, but without the leading 0x prefix, and you will use it without the 0x prefix. Alternatively, you may have already written down your DFN address when you ran the Chrome extension to make the donation, or taken a screenshot of it. In this case, you can use the DFN address from there and you do not have to derive it from your seed phrase. The following is to remind you where it was visible in the Chrome extension. On the Chrome extension’s main page there was an information button (“i” in blue circle) next to the DFN balance: Clicking it presented a window displaying the DFN address: The DFN address displayed in the Chrome extension has a 4-byte checksum at the end and the 0x prefix. For our purposes here, you have to delete the last 8 characters and the prefix. For example: 0x98b20cae8074067c29c07a0a4ad94346cc33ee948bdcfe41 becomes 98b20cae8074067c29c07a0a4ad94346cc33ee94 which is 40 hex characters long. The KYC form will also ask you for your principal. Derive it with Keysmith. echo $seed | keysmith principal -f - The command above will display your principal identifier, which should look something like this: a56gn-wnhrl-i76df-ewgfe-23jfd-dfh03-ergrg-fesr1-1jhs9-reg2o-ure You will be asked to enter your principal identifier on the KYC form. To submit your information, you first go to the KYC landing page. The landing page is a frontend hosted by the DFINITY Foundation and any information entered here is not shared with the external KYC provider. If the DFN address is valid, you are forwarded to the KYC main page. If you are not forwarded and instead see \"Address not found\" then your DFN address is invalid. Please double-check the address. For troubleshooting, see the subsection below. Once you are on the KYC main page, you can submit your personal identifying information (PII). Information entered on this page will be sent directly to the KYC provider. If you have problems with your DFN address, then you can verify it using Etherscan. After you connect to Etherscan, scroll down to row “51. tokens”, open the dropdown form by expanding the row, paste your DFN address in the field “ (address)” and click “Query”. For the example address 2d89d96b10f7a9456a9154b2f5309ee70df5bce1 you will see: If you made a seed donation then you will see the token amount that the FDC calculated. If the DFN address is incorrect then it will show a token amount of 0. Once you have claimed your neurons and completed the KYC process, you can start \"dissolving\" your neurons. YOU ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO READ THIS BLOG POST BEFORE YOU START DISSOLVING YOUR NEURONS. THERE ARE MANY BENEFITS TO NEURON OWNERSHIP. BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE GIVING UP BY DISSOLVING THEM. IN PARTICULAR, YOUR NEURONS A PRE-AGED AT 18-MONTHS, MEANING THAT YOUR VOTING REWARDS RECEIVE A MULTIPLIER EFFECT, WHICH YOU WILL LOSE WHEN YOUR NEURONS ENTER THE DISSOLVE STATE. Dissolving a neuron is not instantaneous, but rather takes place over a period of time known as the \"dissolve delay\". The dissolve delay is a parameter of the individual neuron. In general, different neurons have different dissolve delays. When a neuron is dissolving, its dissolve delay falls over the passage of time, until either it is stopped by you, or it reaches zero. Once the dissolve delay reaches zero, it stops falling, and only then can you instruct the neuron to disburse your ICP tokens. Your neurons have dissolve delays of 0,1,2,…​,30 or 48 months. To start the dissolution of one of your neurons, you must sign and send a message to the governance canister. You can accomplish this in one step on a networked computer using dfx canister call, or as two separate steps, one on an air-gapped computer using dfx canister sign, and another on a networked computer using dfx canister send. We strongly recommend the latter approach to reduce the risk of having your private key compromised.

ICP tokens play a key role in both the governance and economics of the 互联网计算机. This Self-Custody Quick Start scenario assumes: You are a new ICP token holder. You want to understand what you can do with your ICP tokens. You want to know how to convert, transfer, or lock your ICP tokens using the DFINITY Canister SDK command-line interface DFX. If you aren’t yet a token holder, you’ll need to purchase ICP tokens from an exchange or receive a token grant before you can take custody. For an overview of how to get ICP tokens and custody options, see How you can get ICP tokens and Choosing self-custody for digital assets. If you are using another application—such as the Network Nervous System (NNS) application or the user interface provided by a hardware wallet—to interact with your ICP tokens, you should refer to the documentation for that application. This Self-Custody Quick Start focuses solely on interacting with ICP tokens using the DFINITY Canister SDK command-line interface DFX. The following diagram provides a simplified overview of the three most common ways you can use tokens. As this diagram suggests, how you use ICP tokens depends primarily on your goals in acquiring them. If you are a developer or entrepreneur, ICP tokens can be converted to cycles. Cycles can then be used to build and deploy applications to deliver products and services to the market. If you are a member of the community interested in participating in governance and influencing the direction of the 互联网计算机, you can lock up ICP tokens in a stake—called a neuron—so that you can submit and vote on proposals. To get started, verify the following: You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local Intel-based macOS or Linux computer. You know how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer and how to run basic command-line programs in the terminal. You hold ICP tokens in a self-custody wallet. You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister 软件开发工具包 (SDK) by running the following command in a terminal on your local computer: sh -ci \"$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)\" You have created a backup copy of the public/private key for the identity you are using for self-custody. For example, if you are using the default developer identity created using the DFINITY Canister 软件开发工具包 (SDK) dfx command-line interface, you should have a backup of the ~/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem file stored in a secure location. You have a secure environment in which to perform operations involving ICP tokens. As a security best practice, any operations that involve the transfer of ICP tokens would require both an air-gapped computer with minimal hardware and software and a computer connected to the network. In practice, this requires moving files between two computers and taking other precautions to minimize risks. For simplicity, this Self-custody quick start describes how to complete key tasks using a single computer connected to the network. All ICP token transactions are recorded in a ledger canister running on the Internet Computer. These instructions assume that you are using the default developer identity that dfx has created for you. This identity is represented by a principal data type and a textual representation of the principal often referred to as your principal identifier. This representation of your identity is similar to a Bitcoin or Ethereum address. However, the principal associated with your developer identity is typically not the same as your account identifier in the ledger. The principal identifier and the account identifier are related—both provide a textual representation of your identity—but they use different formats. To connect to the ledger and get account information: Create an empty dfx.json file in your current directory by running the following command: echo '{}' > dfx.json Check the current status of the 互联网计算机 network and your ability to connect to it by running the following command dfx ping ic You should see output similar to the following: { \"ic_api_version\": \"0.18.0\" \"impl_hash\": \"d639545e0f38e075ad240fd4ec45d4eeeb11e1f67a52cdd449cd664d825e7fec\" \"impl_version\": \"8dc1a28b4fb9605558c03121811c9af9701a6142\" \"replica_health_status\": \"healthy\" \"root_key\": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 129, 76, 14, 110, 199, 31, 171, 88, 59, 8, 189, 129, 55, 60, 37, 92, 60, 55, 27, 46, 132, 134, 60, 152, 164, 241, 224, 139, 116, 35, 93, 20, 251, 93, 156, 12, 213, 70, 217, 104, 95, 145, 58, 12, 11, 44, 197, 52, 21, 131, 191, 75, 67, 146, 228, 103, 219, 150, 214, 91, 155, 180, 203, 113, 113, 18, 248, 71, 46, 13, 90, 77, 20, 80, 95, 253, 116, 132, 176, 18, 145, 9, 28, 95, 135, 185, 136, 131, 70, 63, 152, 9, 26, 11, 170, 174] } (Optional) Confirm the developer identity you are currently using by running the following command: dfx identity whoami In most cases, you should see that you are currently using your default developer identity. For example: default (Optional) View the textual representation of the principal for your current identity by running the following command: dfx identity get-principal This command displays output similar to the following: tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe Get the account identifier for your developer identity by running the following command: dfx ledger account-id This command displays the ledger account identifier associated with your developer identity. For example, you should see output similar to the following: 03e3d86f29a069c6f2c5c48e01bc084e4ea18ad02b0eec8fccadf4487183c223 Check your account balance by running the following command: dfx ledger --network ic balance This command displays the ICP token balance from the ledger account. For example, you should see output similar to the following: 10.00000000 ICP If you want to use your ICP tokens in your ledger account to power application development, you first must convert them to cycles and transfer the cycles to a canister that will be your cycles wallet. To convert ICP tokens to cycles: Create a new canister with cycles by transferring ICP tokens from your ledger account by running a command similar to the following: dfx ledger --network ic create-canister --amount This command converts the number of ICP tokens you specify for the --amount argument into cycles, and associates the cycles with a new canister identifier controlled by the principal you specify. For example, the following command converts 1.25 ICP tokens into cycles and specifies the principal identifier for the default identity as the controller of the new canister: dfx ledger --network ic create-canister tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe --amount 1.25 If the transaction is successful, the ledger records the event and you should see output similar to the following: Transfer sent at BlockHeight: 20 Canister created with id: \"53zcu-tiaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai\" Install the cycles wallet code in the newly-created canister placeholder by running a command similar to the following: dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet For example: dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet 53zcu-tiaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai This command displays output similar to the following: Creating a wallet canister on the ic network. The wallet canister on the \"ic\" network for user \"default\" is \"53zcu-tiaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai\" If you want to transfer ICP tokens to another account in the ledger, you need to know the account identifier for the destination account. To transfer ICP tokens to another account: Check that you are using an identity with control over the ledger account by running the following command: dfx identity whoami Check the current balance in the ledger account associated with your identity by running the following command: dfx ledger --network ic balance Transfer ICP tokens to another account by running a command similar to the following: dfx ledger --network ic transfer --icp --memo For example: dfx ledger --network ic transfer ae6e1a76da5725bbbf0c5c035aaf0525b791e0f0f7cce27d8e27826389871406 --icp 5 --memo 12345 This example illustrates how to transfer ICP tokens to the specified account using a whole number with the --icp command-line option. You can also specify fractional units of ICP tokens—called e8s—using the --e8s option, either on its own or in conjunction with the --icp option. Alternatively, you can use the --amount to specify the number of ICP tokens to transfer with fractional units up to 8 decimal places, for example, as 5.00000025. The destination address can be an address in the ledger canister running on the 互联网计算机 network, an account you have added using the Network Nervous System application, or the address for a wallet you have on an exchange. If you transfer the ICP tokens to an account in the Network Nervous System application, you might need to refresh the browser to see the transaction reflected. For more information about using the dfx ledger command-line options, see dfx ledger. If you want to lock up ICP tokens to participate in governance and earn rewards, you must use the Network Nervous System (NNS) application or dfx canister call commands. Because locking up ICP tokens to create staked neurons is a more complex process when using the DFINITY Canister SDK command-line interface than it is when using the Network Nervous System (NNS) application, the steps aren’t included in this guide.

You can use this command to compile all of the programs that are defined for a project in the project’s dfx.json configuration file or a specific canister. Note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure. For example, if your project name is hello_world, your current working directory must be the hello_world top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories. The dfx build command looks for the source code to compile using the information you have configured under the canisters section in the dfx.json configuration file. dfx build [flag] [option] [--all | canister_name] You can use the following optional flags with the dfx build command. Flag Description --check Builds canisters using a temporary, hard-coded, locally-defined canister identifier for testing that your program compiles without connecting to the 互联网计算机平台. -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. You can specify the following option for the dfx build command. Option Description --network Specifies the network alias or URL you want to connect to. You can use this option to override the network specified in the dfx.json configuration file. You can specify the following arguments for the dfx build command. Argument Description --all Builds all of the canisters configured in the project’s dfx.json file. canister_name Specifies the name of the canister you want to build. If you are not using the --all option, you can continue to use dfx build or provide a canister name as an argument (the canister name must match at least one name that you have configured in the canisters section of the dfx.json configuration file for your project.) You can use the dfx build command to build one or more WebAssembly modules from the programs specified in the dfx.json configuration file under the canisters key. For example, if your dfx.json configuration file defines one hello_world canister and one hello_world_assets canister, then running dfx build compiles two WebAssembly modules: { \"canisters\": { \"hello_world\": { \"main\": \"src/hello_world/main.mo\", \"type\": \"motoko\" }, \"hello_world_assets\": { \"dependencies\": [ \"hello_world\" ], \"frontend\": { \"entrypoint\": \"src/hello_world_assets/public/index.js\" }, \"source\": [ \"src/hello_world_assets/assets\", \"dist/hello_world_assets/\" ], \"type\": \"assets\" } }, \"defaults\": { \"build\": { \"packtool\": \"\" } }, \"dfx\": \"0.8.2\", \"networks\": { \"local\": { \"bind\": \"127.0.0.1:8000\", \"type\": \"ephemeral\" }, \"ic\": { \"providers\": [ \"https://gw.dfinity.network\" ], \"type\": \"persistent\" } }, \"version\": 1 } Note that the file name and path to the programs on your file system must match the information specified in the dfx.json configuration file. In this example, the hello_world canister contains the main program code and the hello_world_assets canister store front-end code and assets. If you want to keep the hello_world_assets canister defined in the dfx.json file, but only build the back-end program, you could run the following command: dfx build hello_world Building a specific canister is useful when you have multiple canisters defined in the dfx.json file, but want to test and debug operations for canisters independently.

In most cases, you use dfx canister subcommands after you compile a program to manage the canister lifecycle and to perform key tasks such as calling program functions. The basic syntax for running dfx canister commands is: dfx canister [subcommand] [flag] Depending on the dfx canister subcommand you specify, additional arguments, options, and flags might apply or be required. To view usage information for a specific dfx canister subcommand, specify the subcommand and the --help flag. For example, to see usage information for dfx canister call, you can run the following command: dfx canister call --help For reference information and examples that illustrate using dfx canister commands, select an appropriate command. Command Description call Calls a specified method on a deployed canister. create Creates a new \"empty\" canister by registering a canister identifier on the 互联网计算机平台 or the local canister execution environment. delete Deletes a currently stopped canister. help Displays usage information message for a specified subcommand. id Displays the identifier for a canister. install Installs compiled code as a canister on the 互联网计算机平台 or the local canister execution environment. request-status Requests the status of a call to a canister. set-controller Specifies the identity name or principal to use as the new controller for a specified canister on the 互联网计算机平台. send Send a previously-signed message.json to a specified canister identifier. For example, if you want to send a message that calls the network nervous system (NNS) governance canister to manage neurons, you might want to separate message signing from message delivery for security reasons. sign Create a signed message.json file before making a call to a specified canister identifier. For example, if you want to send a message that calls the network nervous system (NNS) governance canister to manage neurons, you might want to separate message signing from message delivery for security reasons. start Restarts a stopped canister. status Requests the running status of a canister. stop Stops a currently running canister. By default, dfx canister commands run on the local canister execution environment specified in the dfx.json file. If you want to send a dfx canister subcommand to the 互联网计算机平台 or a testnet without changing the settings in your dfx.json configuration file, you can explicitly specify the URL to connect to using the --network option. For example, to register unique canister identifiers for a project on the local canister execution environment, you can run the following command: dfx canister create --all If you want to register unique canister identifiers for the same project on the 互联网计算机平台, you can run the following command: dfx canister --network ic create --all The DFINITY Canister SDK comes with an alias of ic, which is configured to point to the 互联网计算机平台. You can also pass a URL as a network option, or you can configure additional aliases in dfx.json under the networks configuration. To illustrate, you can call a canister and function running on a testnet using a command similar to the following: dfx canister --network \\http://192.168.3.1:5678 call counter get Note that you must specify the --network parameter before the canister operation (create or call) and any additional arguments such as the canister name (counter), and function (get). Use the dfx canister call command to call a specified method on a deployed canister. dfx canister call [option] canister_name method_name [argument] [flag] You can use the following optional flags with the dfx canister call command. Flag Description --async Enables you to continue without waiting for the result of the call to be returned by polling the local canister execution environment or the 互联网计算机平台. -h, --help Displays usage information. --query Enables you to send a query request to a deployed canister. For best performance, you should use this flag when you explicitly want to use the query method to retrieve information. For information about the difference between query and update calls, see Canisters include both program and state. --update Enables you to send an update request to a deployed canister. By default, canister calls use the update method. -V, --version Displays version information. You can use the following options with the dfx canister call command. Option Description --output Specifies the output format to use when displaying a method’s return result. The valid values are idl and raw. --type Specifies the data format for the argument when making the call using an argument. The valid values are idl and raw. You can specify the following arguments for the dfx canister call command. Argument Description canister_name Specifies the name of the canister to call. The canister name is a required argument and should match the name you have configured for a project in the canisters section of the dfx.json configuration file. method_name Specifies the method name to call on the canister. The canister method is a required argument. argument Specifies the argument to pass to the method. Depending on your program logic, the argument can be a required or optional argument. You can specify a data format type using the --type option if you pass an argument to the canister. By default, you can specify arguments using the Candid (idl) syntax for data values. For information about using Candid and its supported types, see Interact with a service in a terminal and Supported types. You can use raw as the argument type if you want to pass raw bytes to a canister. You can use the dfx canister call command to invoke specific methods—with or without arguments—after you have deployed the canister using the dfx canister install command. For example, to invoke the get method for a canister with a canister_name of counter, you can run the following command: dfx canister call counter get --async In this example, the command includes the --async option to indicate that you want to make a separate request-status call rather than waiting to poll the local canister execution environment or the 互联网计算机平台 for the result. The --async option is useful when processing an operation might take some time to complete. The option enables you to continue performing other operations then check for the result using a separate dfx canister request-status command. The returned result will be displayed as the IDL textual format. You can explicitly specify that you are passing arguments using the IDL syntax by running commands similar to the following for a Text data type: dfx canister call hello greet --type idl '(\"Lisa\")' (\"Hello, Lisa!\") dfx canister call hello greet '(\"Lisa\")' --type idl (\"Hello, Lisa!\") You can also implicitly use the IDL by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister call hello greet '(\"Lisa\")' (\"Hello, Lisa!\") To specify multiple arguments using the IDL syntax, use commas between the arguments. For example: dfx canister call contacts insert '(\"Amy Lu\",\"01 916-335-2042\")' dfx canister call hotel guestroom '(\"Deluxe Suite\",42,true)' You can pass raw data in bytes by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister call hello greet --type raw '4449444c00017103e29883' This example uses the raw data type to pass a hexadecimal to the greet function of the hello canister. Use the dfx canister create command to register one or more canister identifiers without compiled code. You must be connected to the local canister execution environment or the 互联网计算机平台 to run this command. Note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure. For example, if your project name is hello_world, your current working directory must be the hello_world top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories. The first time you run the dfx canister create command to register an identifier, your public/private key pair credentials are used to create a default user identity. The credentials for the default user are migrated from $HOME/.dfinity/identity/creds.pem to $HOME/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem. dfx canister create [option] [flag] [--all | canister_name] You can use the following optional flags with the dfx canister create command. Flag Description -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. You can use the following options with the dfx canister create command. Option Description --with-cycles Enables you to specify the initial number of cycles in a canister when it is created by your wallet. You can use the following argument with the dfx canister create command. Argument Description --all Enables you to create multiple canister identifiers at once if you have a project dfx.json file that defines multiple canisters. Note that you must specify --all or an individual canister name. canister_name Specifies the name of the canister for which you want to register an identifier. If you are not using the --all option, the canister name is a required argument and must match at least one name that you have configured in the canisters section of the dfx.json configuration file for your project. You can use the dfx canister create command to register canister identifiers without first compiling any code. For example, if you want to create the canister identifier for the project my_counter before writing the program, you can run the following command: dfx canister create my_counter You can use the dfx canister create command with the --with-cycles option to specify the initial balance upon the creation of one canister or all canisters in a project. For example, to specify an initial balance of 8000000000000 cycles for all canisters, run the following command: dfx canister create --with-cycles 8000000000000 --all Use the dfx canister delete command to delete a stopped canister from the local canister execution environment or on the 互联网计算机平台. Note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure. For example, if your project name is hello_world, your current working directory must be the hello_world top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories. dfx canister delete [flag] [--all | canister_name] You can use the following optional flags with the dfx canister delete command. Flag Description -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. You can use the following arguments with the dfx canister delete command. Argument Description --all Deletes all of the canisters configured in the dfx.json file. Note that you must specify --all or an individual canister name. canister_name Specifies the name of the canister you want to delete. Note that you must specify either a canister name or the --all option. You can use the dfx canister delete command to delete a specific canister or all canisters. To delete the hello_world canister, you can run the following command: dfx canister delete hello_world To delete all of the canisters you have deployed on the ic 互联网计算机平台, you can run the following command: dfx canister --network=ic delete --all Use the dfx canister id command to output the canister identifier for a specific canister name. Note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure. For example, if your project name is hello_world, your current working directory must be the hello_world top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories. dfx canister id [flag] canister_name You can use the following optional flags with the dfx canister id command. Flag Description -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. You can use the following argument with the dfx canister id command. Argument Description canister_name Specifies the name of the canister for which you want to display an identifier. You can use the dfx canister id command to display the canister identifier for a specific canister name. To display the canister identifier for the hello_world canister, you can run the following command: dfx canister id hello_world The command displays output similar to the following: 75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q Use the dfx canister install command to install compiled code as a canister on the 互联网计算机平台 or on the local canister execution environment. dfx canister install [flag] [option] [--all | canister_name] You can use the following optional flags with the dfx canister install command. Flag Description --async Enables you to continue without waiting for the result of the installation to be returned by polling the 互联网计算机平台 or the local canister execution environment. -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. You can use the following options with the dfx canister install command. Option Description --argument Specifies an argument to pass to the canister during installation. --argument-type Specifies the data format for the argument when you install using the --argument option. The valid values are idl and raw. By default, you can specify arguments using the Candid (idl) syntax for data values. For information about using Candid and its supported types, see Interact with a service in a terminal and Supported types. You can use raw as the argument type if you want to pass raw bytes to a canister. -c, --compute-allocation Defines a compute allocation—essentially the equivalent of setting a CPU allocation—for canister execution. You can set this value as a percentage in the range of 0 to 100. --memory-allocation Specifies how much memory the canister is allowed to use in total. You can set this value in the range of 0 to 8MB. -m, --mode Specifies whether you want to install, reinstall, or upgrade canisters. For more information about installation modes and canister management, see Managing canisters. You can use the following arguments with the dfx canister install command. Argument Description --all Enables you to install multiple canisters at once if you have a project dfx.json file that includes multiple canisters. Note that you must specify --all or an individual canister name. canister_name Specifies the name of the canister to deploy. If you are not using the --all option, the canister name is a required argument and should match the name you have configured for a project in the canisters section of the dfx.json configuration file. You can use the dfx canister install command to deploy WebAssembly you have compiled using the dfx build command as a canister on the 互联网计算机平台 or on the local canister execution environment. The most common use case is to install all of the canisters by running the following command: dfx canister install --all You can also use the dfx canister install command to deploy a specific canister instead of all of the canisters in your project. For example, if you have a project with a hello_world canister and a hello_world_assets canister but only want to deploy the hello_world canister, you can deploy just that the canister by running the following command: dfx canister install hello_world If you want to submit a request to install the canister and return a request identifier to check on the status of your request later instead of waiting for the command to complete, you can run a command similar to the following: dfx canister install hello_world --async This command submits a request to install the canister and returns a request identifier similar to the following: 0x58d08e785445dcab4ff090463b9e8b12565a67bf436251d13e308b32b5058608 You can then use the request identifier to check the status of the request at a later time, much like a tracking number if you were shipping a package. If you want to deploy a canister on a testnet without changing the settings in your dfx.json configuration file, you can explicitly specify the testnet you want to connect to by using the +--network option. For example, you can specify a testnet URL by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister --network \\http://192.168.3.1:5678 install --all Note that you must specify the network parameter before the canister operation (install) and before the canister name or --all flag. The --compute-allocation options allows you to allocate computing resources as a percentage in the range of 0 to 100 to indicate how often your canister should be scheduled for execution. For example, assume you run the following command: dfx canister install --all --compute-allocation 50 With this setting, all of the canisters in the current projects are assigned a 50% allocation. When canisters in the project receive input messages to process, the messages are scheduled for execution. Over 100 execution cycles, each canister’s messages will be scheduled for processing at least 50 times. The default value for this option is 0—indicating that no specific allocation or scheduling is in effect. If all of your canisters use the default setting, processing occurs in a round-robin fashion. Use the dfx canister request-status command to request the status of a specified call to a canister. This command requires you to specify the request identifier you received after invoking a method on the canister. The request identifier is an hexadecimal string starting with 0x. dfx canister request-status request_id You can use the following optional flags with the dfx canister request-status command. Flag Description -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. You can specify the following argument for the dfx canister request-status command. Argument Description request_id Specifies the hexadecimal string returned in response to a dfx canister call or dfx canister install command. This identifier is an hexadecimal string starting with 0x. You can use the dfx canister request-status command to check on the status of a canister state change or to verify that a call was not rejected by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister request-status 0x58d08e785445dcab4ff090463b9e8b12565a67bf436251d13e308b32b5058608 This command displays an error message if the request identifier is invalid or refused by the canister. Use the dfx canister set-controller command to specify the identity name or principal to use as the new controller for a specified canister on the 互联网计算机平台. A controller identity has special rights to manage the canister it controls. For example, only a controlling identity can be used to install, upgrade, or delete the canister under its control. Note that you can specify either a user identity or a canister as a controller. You can also specify the controller identity by using its name or its principal. dfx canister set-controller [flag] canister new-controller You can use the following optional flags with the dfx canister set-controller command. Flag Description -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. You must use the following arguments with the dfx canister set-controller command. Argument Description Specifies the canister name or canister identifier to be controlled by the identity you specify using the new_controller argument. Specifies the identity name or principal of the controller. You can use the dfx canister set-controller command to specify a user or canister as the controlling identity for a specific canister. For example, you might create a new identity called pubsadmin then run the dfx canister set-controller to specify that you want the pubsadmin identity to be the controller of the hello_world canister by running the following commands: dfx identity new pubsadmin dfx canister set-controller hello_world pubsadmin To set the controlling identity using the textual representation of the identity principal, you might run a command similar to the following: dfx canister set-controller hello_world wcp5u-pietp-k5jz4-sdaaz-g3x4l-zjzxa-lxnly-fp2mk-j3j77-25qat-pqe Although specifying a user identity name or principal is one potential use case, a more common scenario is to specify the wallet canister that you want to use to send cycles to the canister. The following steps illustrate this scenario when you are doing local development. For this example, assume you have created a project called open_sf with two canisters deployed on the local canister execution environment. Create an identity—for example, sf-controller—to act as the controller. dfx identity new sf-controller Creating identity: \"sf-controller\". Created identity: \"sf-controller\". Make the new identity the active identity. dfx identity use sf-controller Using identity: \"sf-controller\". Generate a wallet canister identifier for the new identity. dfx identity get-wallet Creating a wallet canister on the local canister execution environment. r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai The wallet canister on the the local canister execution environment for user \"sf-controller\" is \"r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai\" Switch the active identity to the current controller of the canister. For example, if the default identity was used to create the canister, you would run the following command: dfx identity use default Using identity: \"default\". Set the controller for a specified canister to use the wallet associated wit the sf-controller identity. dfx canister set-controller open_sf_assets r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai Set \"r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai\" as controller of \"open_sf_assets\". You can now use the wallet canister r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai to send cycles or add custodians to the open_sf_assets canister. Use the dfx canister send command after signing a message with the dfx canister sign command when you want to separate these steps, rather than using the single dfx canister call command. Using separate calls can add security to the transaction. For example, when creating your neuron stake, you might want to use the dfx canister sign command to create a signed message.json file using an air-gapped computer, then use the dfx canister send command to deliver the signed message. dfx canister send file_name You can use the following optional flags with the dfx canister request-status command. Flag Description -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. You can specify the following argument for the dfx canister send command. Argument Description file_name Specifies the file name of the message. Use the dfx canister send command to send a signed message created using the dfx canister sign command to the genesis token canister (GTC) to create a neuron on your behalf by running the following command: dfx canister send message.json Use the dfx canister sign command before sending a message with the dfx canister send command when you want to separate these steps, rather than using the single dfx canister call command. Using separate calls can add security to the transaction. For example, when creating your neuron stake, you might want to use the dfx canister sign command to create a signed message.json file using an air-gapped computer, then use the dfx canister send command to deliver the signed message from a computer connected to the 互联网计算机平台. dfx canister sign [flag] [option] canister-name method-name [argument] You can use the following optional flags with the dfx canister sign command. Flag Description -h, --help Displays usage information. --query Sends a query request to a canister. --update Sends an update request to the canister. This is the default method if the --query method is not used. -V, --version Displays version information. You can specify the following options for the dfx canister sign command. Option Description --expire-after Specifies how long will will be valid before it expires and cannot be sent. Specify in seconds. If not defined, the default is 300s (5m) --file Specifies the output file name. The default is message.json. --random Specifies the configuration for generating random arguments. --type Specifies the data type for the argument when making a call using an argument. By default, you can specify arguments using the Candid (idl) syntax for data values. For information about using Candid and its supported types, see Interact with a service in a terminal and Supported types. You can use raw as the argument type if you want to pass raw bytes. You can specify the following arguments for the dfx canister sign command. Argument Description canister_name Specifies the name of the canister to call. The canister name is a required argument and should match the name you have configured for a project in the canisters section of the dfx.json configuration file. method_name Specifies the method name to call on the canister. The canister method is a required argument. argument Specifies the argument to pass to the method. Depending on your program logic, the argument can be a required or optional argument. You can specify a data format type using the --type option if you pass an argument to the canister. By default, you can specify arguments using the Candid (idl) syntax for data values. For information about using Candid and its supported types, see Interact with a service in a terminal and Supported types. You can use raw as the argument type if you want to pass raw bytes. Use the dfx canister sign command to create a signed message.json file using the principal associated with the identity you created using the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) file by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister --no-wallet --network=ic sign --expire-after=1h rno2w-sqaaa-aaaaa-aaacq-cai create_neurons ‘(“PUBLIC_KEY”)’ Currently, the --no-wallet command must be used to execute the command using the user identity instead of the cycles wallet canister identifier. This command illustrates how to creates a message.json file to create neurons on the 互联网计算机平台 specified by the ic alias, that is signed using your principal identifier as the message sender and with an expiration window that ends in one hour. Note that the time allotted to send a signed message is a fixed 5-minute window. The --expire-after option enables you to specify the point in time when the 5-minute window for sending the signed message should end. For example, if you set the --expire-after option to one hour (1h), you must wait at least 55 minutes before you send the generated message and the signature for the message is only valid during the 5-minute window ending in the 60th minute. In this example, therefore, you would need to send the message after 55 minutes and before 60 minutes for the message to be recognized as valid. If you don’t specify the --expire-after option, the default expiration is five minutes. Send the signed message to the genesis token canister (GTC) to create a neuron on your behalf by running the following command: dfx canister send message.json Use the dfx canister start command to restart a stopped canister on the 互联网计算机平台 or the local canister execution environment. In most cases, you run this command after you have stopped a canister to properly terminate any pending requests as a prerequisite to upgrading the canister.

The first time you run the dfx canister create command to register an identifier, your public/private key pair credentials are used to create a default user identity. The credentials for the default user are migrated from $HOME/.dfinity/identity/creds.pem to $HOME/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem. You can then use dfx identity new to create new user identities and store credentials for those identities in $HOME/.config/dfx/identity//identity.pem files. For example, you can create an identity named ic_admin by running the following command: dfx identity new ic_admin This command adds a private key for the ic_admin user identity in the ~/.config/dfx/identity/ic_admin/identity.pem file. Use the dfx identity get-principal command to display the textual representation of a principal associated with the current user identity context. If you haven’t created any user identities, you can use this command to display the principal for the default user. The textual representation of a principal can be useful for establishing and testing role-based authorization scenarios. dfx identity get-principal [flag] You can use the following optional flags with the dfx identity get-principal command. Flag Description -h, --help Displays usage information. -V, --version Displays version information. If you want to display the textual representation of a principal associated with a specific user identity context, you can run commands similar to the following: dfx identity use ic_admin dfx identity get-principal In this example, the first command sets the user context to use the ic_admin identity. The second command then returns the principal associated with the ic_admin identity. Use the dfx identity get-wallet command to display the canister identifier for the wallet associated with your current identity principal. Note that you must be connected to the 互联网计算机平台 or the local canister execution environment to run this command. In addition, you must be in a project directory to run the command.

Computer主要是运行软件的分布式和去中心化平台。 为运行在Internet Computer上的应用程序编写源代码时，会将源代码编译为WebAssembly模块。 当您在Internet Computer副本上部署包含程序的WebAssembly模块时，该程序将在称为软件Canister的概念性计算单元内执行。 部署后，用户可以通过前端客户端（例如浏览器）访问您为Canister定义的入口点功能与之交互。 软件Canister与容器相似，两者都部署为包含为应用或服务编译后的代码和依赖的软件单元。 容器化允许将应用程序与环境分离，从而实现简单而可靠的部署。 但是，Canister与容器的不同之处在于，它还存储有关当前软件状态的信息以及先前事件和用户交互的记录。 尽管容器化的应用程序可能包含有关该应用程序运行环境的状态的信息，但是Canister能够保留应用程序功能使用而导致的状态更改的记录。 这种由程序和状态组成的Canister的概念非常重要，因为当通过向其入口点之一发送消息来调用Canister功能时，只有两种类型的调用：非提交查询调用和提交更新调用 类型 关键点 查询调用 允许用户查询Canister当前状态或调用一个Canister的不改变状态的函数 同步并且立即响应 可以被持有Canister且无需共识即可验证结果的任何节点调用。 在安全性和性能之间存在内在平衡，因为来自单个节点的答复可能是不可信的或不准确的。 不允许修改Canister的状态，本质上，程序使用查询调用来执行只读操作 不允许被调用Canister调用其他Canister作为容器间调用暴露的方法(这个限制是临时的，在将来Canister可以调用其他Canister暴露的方法) 更新调用 允许用户修改Canister状态并保留更改 异步 必须通过共识才能返回结果。 由于需要达成共识，因此更改容器的状态可能会花费一些时间。 因此，更新调用使用基于Actor的编程模型（状态隔离）来允许并发和异步处理。 在安全性和性能之间存在内在权衡，因为子网中三分之二的副本必须就结果达成一致。 被调用的Canister可以调用其他Canister公开的函数 作为开发人员，重要的是要认识到查询的调用与更改状态的调用之间的这种关系。 特别是，您应牢记安全性和性能之间的内在平衡。 对于程序员和软件开发人员而言，Internet Computer平台在提供了独特功能和机会的框架，从而简化了您设计，构建和部署应用程序的方式。 该框架的关键部分是一种新的通用编程语言Motoko。 Motoko是一种编程语言，经过专门设计，可以充分利用Internet Computer提供的独特功能，包括： 直接使用actor对象和类定义程序的能力。 使用async和await语法来像处理同步消息一样处理异步消息 自动支持消息序列化和反序列化。 无需外部数据库或存储即可使用数据结构持久性的能力。 作为一种现代的高级编程语言，Motoko提供了一些自己的关键功能，包括： 支持大整数运算和溢出保护。 一种声音类型系统，它会静态检查每个程序，以确保其可以在所有可能的输入上都没有类型错误的情况下执行。 支持抽象函数，用户定义类型和用户定义Actor 有关Motoko编程语言更多详细信息，包括语法约定和受支持的功能，请参阅 Motoko 编程语言. 下图提供了作为Internet Computer生态系统一部分的开发环境的简化drill-down视图。 用motoko语言编写程序时最重要的原则是，Motoko使用基于Actor的编程模型 Actor是一种特殊的对象，它以隔离状态处理消息，从而使消息可以远程和异步地进行处理。 Internet Computer平台的许多关键功能都依赖于这种类型的安全有效的异步消息处理。 通常，每个软件Canister都包含一个Actor对象的已编译代码。 每个Canister还包括一些其他信息，例如界面描述或前端资源。 您可以创建包含多个Canister的项目，但是每个Canister只能包含一个Actor。 当编译Motoko代码时，结果是WebAssembly模块。 WebAssembly是一种可移植的抽象低级计算机指令格式，可在大多数现代计算机硬件上执行。 它在互联网上运行的程序得到广泛支持，并且天然适合于部署哪计划在Internet Computer平台上运行的应用程序。 使用Motoko，开发人员可以编译为可移植WebAssembly，同时仍可以发布为简单的高级语言应用程序。 Motoko语言提供了其他高级现代语言所共有的许多特性，例如类型安全和模式匹配。 此外，Motoko提供了内置的支持，以使用actor定义消息传递服务的方式特别适合Internet Computer平台，并且无论您是新手还是经验丰富的程序员，都可以轻松了解。 本指南介绍了Motoko编程语言基本特性，更多详细信息请参见 Motoko编程语言. 用户调用容器操作与容器间操作之间的主要区别之一是，容器在[IC]上具有明确注册的身份。 IC上没有存储用户身份的中央注册表。 每个用户通过一个或多个公私钥对与访问的Canister相关联。 用户的私钥用于签名消息，消息与公钥一起发送到Canister。 [IC]对用户进行身份验证，然后将委托人传递给Canister以授权其操作。 较高层级上，用户首次在与Internet Computer进行交互时会生成一个未签名的密钥对，并从公用密钥中获取其用户信息。使用已由用户代理安全存储的私钥（或多个私钥）对返回的用户进行身份验证。可以访问多个Canister的用户可以管理用于与每个Canister关联的身份验证的密钥和设备。 单个用户可以具有多个公私钥对，以从不同的设备（例如在不同的计算机，移动电话或平板电脑上运行的浏览器）访问Canister，但是这些派生的密钥都映射到主身份。 通常，所有Canister都会以以下形式消耗资源：CPU执行，路由消息带宽和持久数据内存。 Canister维护帐户的Cycles余额，以支付其应用程序消耗的通信，计算和存储成本。 Cycles反映实际的操作成本，包括物理硬件，机架空间，能源，存储设备和带宽，以使程序执行的成本保持不变或随着操作效率的降低而降低。 程序必须能够支付完整执行费用（全部或全部不付），但与单位Cycles相关的成本将使高效的程序具有成本效益。 通过设置Canister可以消耗多少个Cycle的限制，该平台可以防止恶意代码消耗资源。 运营成本的相对稳定性使得更容易预测处理例如一百万条消息所需的Cycle。 如果要查找有关Canister的更多信息，请查看以下相关资源： 介绍Canister-智能合约的演化（视频） 什么是Dfinity Canister SDK？（视频） 部署你的第一个应用（视频）","title":"Canisters and

Computer生态系统中，ICP代币是种原生的，实用的，价值在公开市场上确定的代币。 ICP代币在Internet Computer的治理和经济方面均发挥着关键作用。 作为Internet Computer的实用代币，您可以通过几种不同的方式来获取。 例如： 交易所购买 投资认领 通过Internet Computer协会（ICA）或DFINITY 基金会获得 以节点提供者或数据中心提供计算能力来获取 如果您有ICP代币，但不确定如何使用它们，下图将提供简化的概述，以说明三种最常见的情况。 如该图所示，如何使用ICP代币主要取决于您获取ICP的目标。 例如，如果您是开发人员或企业家，则ICP可以转换为Cycle。 然后可以使用Cycle来构建和部署应用程序，以将产品和服务推向市场。 如果您是有兴趣参与治理并影响Internet Computer方向的社区成员，则可以锁定ICP（称为神经元），以便您可以提交提案并对其进行投票。 对于开发人员来说，ICP代币很重要，因为可以将其转换为Cycles，可以用来支付计算和资源消耗。 例如，假设您有一所房子，天然气用于热水器，厨房炉灶，烘干机和供暖器。 使用这些设备时，会消耗天然气，所以需要定期与供应商联系以补充气源，以便您可以继续使用设备而不会受到干扰。 这与Canister类似，因为每个Canister都必须有一个具有可用Cycles的帐户，以支付应用程序消耗的通信，计算和存储费用。 当Canister账户需要补充Cycles时，ICP代币持有人可以将代币转换为cycles。 Cycles反映了Internet Computer平台中托管的应用程序的实际运营成本，包括物理硬件，机架空间，能源，存储设备和带宽等资源。 简而言之，Cycles代表执行每个应用程序的WebAssembly指令的成本。 程序必须能够支付全部执行费用（全部执行或不执行任何操作），但是平台对Canister可持有和消耗的Cycles数设置了限制，以防止恶意代码浪费资源。 运营成本的相对稳定性使得更容易预测处理例如一百万条消息所需的Cycles。 与通信，计算和存储相关的成本，随着时间的推移会降低，例如，因为磁盘空间变得更便宜或硬件效率更高。 尽管可以使用ICP代币向Canister添加Cycles，但是Cycles本身不是货币，也没有流动性或资产属性。 Cycles不能转换回到ICP代币，但可以在Canister之间转移。 代币反映了网络的价值并且会波动。 为了防止代币价值影响Canister可以处理的消息数量，代币不用于直接支付网络资源。 代币可以在持有者之间交换，也可以锁定在神经元中，作为平台治理系统的一部分来确保投票权利。 代币奖励给提供计算能力的数据中心和参与平台治理系统中对提案投票的利益相关者。 借助此模型，Internet Computer平台为数据中心提供者提供了计算能力的可预测经济模型。 数据中心提供者可以为活动节点和备用节点获得补偿，从而使网络具有处理正常流量和工作量高峰的能力。 如果Internet Computer网络需要额外的容量，则可以向潜在的数据中心提供商招标。 如果出价被接受，则数据中心提供商会与之签约，以在给定的时间内为给定数量的服务器提供可接受的服务可用性级别。 例如，某数据中心提供商可能合同约定提供10台30天内正常运行的服务器。 即使这些节点没有托管任何Canister，仅用作备用节点，数据中心提供商也将作为网络的一部分获得可用性补偿。 Internet Computer经济模型将管理能力的大部分权力和责任置于治理系统（即网络神经系统）上。 有关补偿和服务水平要求的特定详细信息不在本文档范围之内。 如果要查找有关代币和Cycles的更多信息，请查看以下相关资源： * Overview of Token Economics

The public key combined with the canister smart contract identifier the user accesses forms a security principal that can then be used as a message caller to authenticate function calls made to the canister smart contract running on the 互联网计算机. The following diagram provides a simplified view of how user identities authenticate message callers. Before starting the tutorial, verify the following: You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have run at least one command that resulted in your default user identity being created. Your default user identity is stored globally for all projects in the $HOME/.config/dfx/identity/ directory. You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for Motoko as described in Install the language editor plug-in if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE. You have stopped any local canister execution environment processes running on your computer. To create a new project directory for testing access control and switching user identities: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using one. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new access_hello Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd access_hello For this tutorial, you are going to replace the template source code file with a dapp that has functions for assigning and retrieving roles. To modify the default dapp: Open the src/access_hello/main.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file: // Import base modules import AssocList \"mo:base/AssocList\"; import Error \"mo:base/Error\"; import List \"mo:base/List\"; shared({ caller = initializer }) actor class() { // Establish role-based greetings to display public shared({ caller }) func greet(name : Text) : async Text { if (has_permission(caller, #assign_role)) { return \"Hello, \" # name # \". You have a role with administrative privileges.\" } else if (has_permission(caller, #lowest)) { return \"Welcome, \" # name # \". You have an authorized account. Would you like to play a game?\"; } else { return \"Greetings, \" # name # \". Nice to meet you!\"; } }; // Define custom types public type Role = { #owner; #admin; #authorized; }; public type Permission = { #assign_role; #lowest; }; private stable var roles: AssocList.AssocList = List.nil(); private stable var role_requests: AssocList.AssocList = List.nil(); func principal_eq(a: Principal, b: Principal): Bool { return a == b; }; func get_role(pal: Principal) : ?Role { if (pal == initializer) { ?#owner; } else { AssocList.find(roles, pal, principal_eq); } }; // Determine if a principal has a role with permissions func has_permission(pal: Principal, perm : Permission) : Bool { let role = get_role(pal); switch (role, perm) { case (?#owner or ?#admin, _) true; case (?#authorized, #lowest) true; case (_, _) false; } }; // Reject unauthorized user identities func require_permission(pal: Principal, perm: Permission) : async () { if ( has_permission(pal, perm) == false ) { throw Error.reject( \"unauthorized\" ); } }; // Assign a new role to a principal public shared({ caller }) func assign_role( assignee: Principal, new_role: ?Role ) : async () { await require_permission( caller, #assign_role ); switch new_role { case (?#owner) { throw Error.reject( \"Cannot assign anyone to be the owner\" ); }; case (_) {}; }; if (assignee == initializer) { throw Error.reject( \"Cannot assign a role to the canister owner\" ); }; roles := AssocList.replace(roles, assignee, principal_eq, new_role).0; role_requests := AssocList.replace(role_requests, assignee, principal_eq, null).0; }; public shared({ caller }) func request_role( role: Role ) : async Principal { role_requests := AssocList.replace(role_requests, caller, principal_eq, ?role).0; return caller; }; // Return the principal of the message caller/user identity public shared({ caller }) func callerPrincipal() : async Principal { return caller; }; // Return the role of the message caller/user identity public shared({ caller }) func my_role() : async ?Role { return get_role(caller); }; public shared({ caller }) func my_role_request() : async ?Role { AssocList.find(role_requests, caller, principal_eq); }; public shared({ caller }) func get_role_requests() : async List.List { await require_permission( caller, #assign_role ); return role_requests; }; public shared({ caller }) func get_roles() : async List.List { await require_permission( caller, #assign_role ); return roles; }; }; Let’s take a look at a few key elements of this dapp: You might notice that the greet function is a variation on the greet function you have seen in previous tutorials. In this dapp, however, the greet function uses a message caller to determine the permissions that should be applied and, based on the permissions associated with the caller, which greeting to display. The dapp defines two custom types—one for Roles and one for Permissions. The assign_roles function enables the message caller to assign a role to the principal associated with an identity. The callerPrincipal function enables you to return the principal associated with an identity. The my_role function enables you to return the role that is associated with an identity. Save your changes and close the main.mo file to continue. Before you can build the access_hello project, you need to connect to the local canister execution environment running in your development environment or to the 互联网计算机 mainnet. To start the local canister execution environment: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. Start the local canister execution environment on your computer by running the following command: dfx start --background After the local canister execution environment completes its startup operations, you can continue to the next step. After you connect to the local canister execution environment running in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp in a single step by running the dfx deploy command. You can also perform each of these steps independently using separate dfx canister create, dfx build, and dfx canister install commands. To deploy the dapp locally: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Register, build, and deploy the access_hello back-end dapp by running the following command: dfx deploy access_hello Creating a wallet canister on the local network. The wallet canister on the \"local\" network for user \"default\" is \"rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai\" Deploying: access_hello Creating canisters... Creating canister \"access_hello\"... \"access_hello\" canister created with canister id: \"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai\" Building canisters... Installing canisters... Installing code for canister access_hello, with canister_id rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai Deployed canisters. Before we create any additional identities, let’s review the principal identifiers associated with your default identity and the cycles wallet for your default identity. On the 互联网计算机, a principal is the internal representative for a user, canister smart contract, node, or subnet. The textual representation for a principal is the external identifier you see displayed with working with the principal data type. To review your current identity and principle: Verify the currently-active identity by running the following command: dfx identity whoami The command displays output similar to the following: default Check the principal for the default user identity by running the following command: dfx identity get-principal The command displays output similar to the following: zen7w-sjxmx-jcslx-ey4hf-rfxdq-l4soz-7ie3o-hti3o-nyoma-nrkwa-cqe Check the role associated with the default user identity by running the following command: dfx canister --wallet=$(dfx identity get-wallet) call access_hello my_role The command displays output similar to the following: (opt variant { owner }) To begin testing the access controls in our dapp, let’s create some new user identities and assign those users to different roles. To create a new user identity: Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed. Create a new administrative user identity by running the following command: dfx identity new ic_admin The command displays output similar to the following: Creating identity: \"ic_admin\". Created identity: \"ic_admin\". Call the my_role function to see that your new user identity has not been assigned to any role. dfx --identity ic_admin canister call access_hello my_role The command displays output similar to the following: Creating a wallet canister on the local network. The wallet canister on the \"local\" network for user \"ic_admin\" is \"ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai\" (null) Switch your currently-active identity context to use the new ic_admin user identity and display the principal associated with the ic_admin user by running the following command: dfx identity use ic_admin && dfx identity get-principal The command displays output similar to the following: Using identity: \"ic_admin\". c5wa6-3irl7-tuxuo-4vtyw-xsnhw-rv2a6-vcmdz-bzkca-vejmd-327zo-wae Check the principal used to call the access_hello canister smart contract by running the following command: dfx canister call access_hello callerPrincipal The command displays output similar to the following: (principal \"ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai\") By default, the cycles wallet identifier is the principal used to call the methods in the access_hello canister smart contract. To illustrate access control, however, we want to use the principal associated with the user context, not the cycles wallet. Before we get to that step, though, let’s assign a role to the ic_admin user. To do that, we need to switch to the default user identity that has the owner role. To assign the admin role to the ic_admin identity: Switch your currently-active identity context to use the default user identity by running the following command: dfx identity use default Assign the ic_admin principal the admin role by running a command similar to the following using Candid syntax: dfx canister --wallet=$(dfx identity get-wallet) call access_hello assign_role '((principal \"c5wa6-3irl7-tuxuo-4vtyw-xsnhw-rv2a6-vcmdz-bzkca-vejmd-327zo-wae\"),opt variant{admin})' Be sure to replace the principal hash with the one returned by the dfx identity get-principal command for the ic_admin identity. + Optionally, you can rerun the command to call the my_role function to verify the role assignment. + dfx --identity ic_admin canister call access_hello my_role + The command displays output similar to the following: + (opt variant { admin }) Call the greet function using the ic_admin user identity that you just assigned the admin role by running the following command: dfx --identity ic_admin canister call access_hello greet \"Internet Computer Admin\" The command displays output similar to the following: ( \"Hello, Internet Computer Admin. You have a role with administrative privileges.\", ) At this point, you have a default user identity with the owner role and an ic_admin user identity with the admin role. Let’s add another user identity and assign it to the authorized role. For this example, however, we’ll use an environment variable to store the user’s principal. To add a new authorized user identity: Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed. Create a new authorized user identity by running the following command: dfx identity new alice_auth The command displays output similar to the following: Creating identity: \"alice_auth\". Created identity: \"alice_auth\". Switch your currently-active identity context to use the new alice_auth user identity by running the following command: dfx identity use alice_auth Store the principal for the alice_auth user in an environment variable by running the following command: ALICE_ID=$(dfx identity get-principal) You can verify the principal stored by running the following command: echo $ALICE_ID The command displays output similar to the following: b5quc-npdph-l6qp4-kur4u-oxljq-7uddl-vfdo6-x2uo5-6y4a6-4pt6v-7qe Use the ic_admin identity to assign the authorized role to alice_auth by running the following command: dfx --identity ic_admin canister call access_hello assign_role \"(principal \\\"$ALICE_ID\\\", opt variant{authorized})\" Call the my_role function to verify the role assignment. dfx --identity alice_auth canister call access_hello my_role The command displays output similar to the following: (opt variant { authorized }) Call the greet function using the alice_auth user identity that you just assigned the authorized role by running the following command: dfx canister call access_hello greet \"Alice\" The command displays output similar to the following: ( \"Welcome, Alice. You have an authorized account. Would you like to play a game?\", ) You have now seen a simple example of creating users with specific roles and permissions. The next step is to create a user identity that is not assigned to a role or given any special permissions. To add an unauthorized user identity: Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed. Check your currently-active identity, if needed, by running the following command: dfx identity whoami Create a new user identity by running the following command: dfx identity new bob_standard The command displays output similar to the following: Creating identity: \"bob_standard\". Created identity: \"bob_standard\". Store the principal for the bob_standard user in an environment variable by running the following command: BOB_ID=$(dfx --identity bob_standard identity get-principal) Attempt to use the bob_standard identity to assign a role. dfx --identity bob_standard canister call access_hello assign_role \"(principal \\\"$BOB_ID\\\", opt variant{authorized})\" This command returns an unauthorized error. Attempt to use the default user identity to assign bob_standard the owner role by running the following command: dfx --identity default canister --wallet=$(dfx --identity default identity get-wallet) call access_hello assign_role \"(principal \\\"$BOB_ID\\\", opt variant{owner})\" This command fails because users cannot be assigned the owner role. Call the greet function using the bob_standard user identity by running the following command: dfx --identity bob_standard canister --no-wallet call access_hello greet \"Bob\" The command displays output similar to the following: (\"Greetings, Bob. Nice to meet you!\") So far, you have seen how to create and switch between user identities for individual commands. You can also specify a user identity you want to use, then run multiple commands in the context of that user identity. To run multiple commands under one user identity: Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed. List the user identities currently available by running the following command: dfx identity list The command displays output similar to the following with an asterisk indicating the currently-active user identity. alice_auth bob_standard default * ic_admin In this example, the default user identity is used unless you explicitly select a different identity. Select a new user identity from the list and make it the active user context by running a command similar to the following: dfx identity use ic_admin + The command displays output similar to the following: Using identity: \"ic_admin\". If you rerun the dfx identity list command, the ic_admin user identity displays an asterisk to indicate it is the currently active user context. You can now run commands using the selected user identity without specifying --identity on the command-line. After you finish experimenting with the dapp and using identities, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background. To stop the local canister execution environment: In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process. Stop the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx stop If you are looking for more information about identity and authentication, check out the following related resources: dfx identity (command reference) Set an identity to own a canister smart contract (how-to)","title":"Add access control with identities","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"access-control","url":"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/access-control.html","titles":[{"text":"Before you begin","id":"_before_you_begin"},{"text":"Create a new project","id":"_create_a_new_project"},{"text":"Modify the default dapp","id":"_modify_the_default_dapp"},{"text":"Start the local canister execution environment","id":"_start_the_local_canister_execution_environment"},{"text":"Register, build, and deploy the dapp","id":"_register_build_and_deploy_the_dapp"},{"text":"Check the current identity context","id":"_check_the_current_identity_context"},{"text":"Create a new user identity","id":"_create_a_new_user_identity"},{"text":"Assign a role to an identity","id":"_assign_a_role_to_an_identity"},{"text":"Add an authorized user identity","id":"_add_an_authorized_user_identity"},{"text":"Add an unauthorized user identity","id":"_add_an_unauthorized_user_identity"},{"text":"Set the user identity for multiple commands","id":"_set_the_user_identity_for_multiple_commands"},{"text":"Stop the local canister execution environment","id":"_stop_the_local_canister_execution_environment"},{"text":"Want to learn more?","id":"_want_to_learn_more"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/at-a-glance.html":{"text":"The Quick start provides a fast path to deploying a simple default application without stopping to admire the scenery along the way.

For this tutorial, the actor is named Calc. The program uses the cell variable to contain an integer number that represents the current result of a calculator operation. This program supports the following function calls: The add function call accepts input and performs addition. The sub function call accepts input and performs subtraction. The mul function call accepts input and performs multiplication. The div function call accepts input and performs division. The clearall function clears the cell value stored as the result of previous operations, resetting the cell value to zero. The div function also includes code to prevent the program from attempting to divide by zero. Before starting the tutorial, verify the following: You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have stopped any canister execution environment running on the local computer. This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. To create a new project for this tutorial: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using one. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new calc Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd calc For this tutorial, let’s modify the default dfx.json configuration file to use a more specific name for its main program. To modify the default dfx.json configuration file: Open the dfx.json configuration file in a text editor. Change the main key setting from the default main.mo program name to calc_main.mo. For example: \"main\": \"src/calc/calc_main.mo\", For this tutorial, changing the name of the source file from main.mo to calc_main.mo simply illustrates how the setting in the dfx.json configuration file determines the source file to be compiled. In a more complex dapp, you might have multiple source files instead of a single main program file. More complex applications might also have specific dependencies between multiple source files that you need to manage using settings in the dfx.json configuration file. In a scenario like that—with multiple canisters and programs defined in your dfx.json file—having multiple files all named main.mo might make navigating your workspace more difficult. The name you choose for each program isn’t significant, but it is important that the name you set in the dfx.json file matches the name of your program in the file system. Save your changes and close the file to continue. For this tutorial, you need to replace the default program with a program that performs basic arithmetic operations. To replace the default program: Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed. Copy the template main.mo file to create a new file named calc_main.mo by running the following command: cp src/calc/main.mo src/calc/calc_main.mo Open the src/calc/calc_main.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the calc_main.mo file: // This single-cell calculator defines one calculator instruction per // public entry point (add, sub, mul, div). // Create a simple Calc actor. actor Calc { var cell : Int = 0; // Define functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide public func add(n:Int) : async Int { cell += n; cell }; public func sub(n:Int) : async Int { cell -= n; cell }; public func mul(n:Int) : async Int { cell *= n; cell }; public func div(n:Int) : async ?Int { if ( n == 0 ) { return null // null indicates div-by-zero error } else { cell /= n; ?cell } }; // Clear the calculator and reset to zero public func clearall() : async Int { if (cell : Int != 0) cell -= cell; return cell }; }; You might notice that this sample code uses integer (Int) data types, enabling you to use positive or negative numbers. If you wanted to restrict the functions in this calculator code to only use positive numbers, you could change the data type to only allow natural (Nat) data. Save your changes and close the file to continue. Before you can build the calc project, you need to connect to the canister execution environment running locally in your development environment, or you need to connect toa subnet that you can access. Starting the network locally requires a dfx.json file, so you should be sure you are in your project’s root directory. For this tutorial, you should have two separate terminal shells, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another. To start the local canister execution environment: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. You should now have two terminals open. You should have the project directory as your current working directory. Start the local canister execution environment on your machine by running the following command: dfx start After you start the local network, the terminal displays messages about network operations. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your new project. After you connect to the local canister execution environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp locally. To deploy the dapp locally: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Register, build, and deploy your dapp by running the following command: dfx deploy The dfx deploy command output displays information about the operations it performs. You now have a program deployed as a canister smart contract on your local canister execution environment. You can test the program by using dfx canister call commands. To test the program you have deployed: Use the dfx canister call command to call the calc canister add function and pass it the input argument 10 by running the following command: dfx canister call calc add '(10)' When you pass an argument enclosed by the single quotation marks and parentheses,the interface description language (IDL) parses the argument type, so you don’t need to specify the argument type manually. Verify that the command returns the value expected for the add function. For example, the program displays output similar to the following: (10) Call the mul function and pass it the input argument 3 by running the following command: dfx canister call calc mul '(3)' Verify that the command returns the value expected for the mul function. For example, the program displays output similar to the following: (30) Call the sub function and pass it the input argument 5 of type number by running the following command: dfx canister call calc sub '(5)' Verify that the command returns the value expected for the sub function. For example, the program displays output similar to the following: (25) Call the div function and pass it the input argument 5 by running the following command: dfx canister call calc div '(5)' Verify that the command returns the value expected for the div function. For example, the program displays output similar to the following: (opt 5) You might notice that the div function returns an optional result. The program makes the result optional to enable the div function to return null in the case of a division-by-zero error. Because the cell variable in this program is an integer, you can also call its functions and specify negative input values. For example, you might run the following command: dfx canister call calc mul '(-4)' which returns: (-20) Call the clearall function and verify it resets the cell value to zero: dfx canister call calc clearall For example, the program displays output similar to the following: (0) The canister interface description language—often referred to as Candid or more generally as the IDL—provides a common language for specifying the signature of a canister smart contract. Candid provides a unified way for you to interact with canister smart contracts that are written in different languages or accessed using different tools. For example, Candid provides a consistent view of a service whether the underlying program is native Rust, JavaScript, or Motoko. Candid also enables different tools—such as the dfx command-line interface and the Network Nervous System dapp—to share a common description for a service. Based on the type signature of the actor, Candid also provides a web interface that allows you to call canister functions for testing and debugging. After you have deployed your project in the local canister execution environment using the dfx deploy or dfx canister install command, you can access the Candid web interface endpoint in a browser. This web interface—the Candid UI—exposes the service description in a form, enabling you to quickly view and test functions and experiment with entering different data types without writing any front-end code. To use the Candid web interface to test canister functions: Find the Candid UI canister identifier associated with the current project using the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command. dfx canister id __Candid_UI The command displays the canister identifier for the Candid UI with output similar to the following: r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai Copy the Candid UI canister identifier so that it is available in the clipboard. If you’ve stopped the local canister execution environment, restart it locally by running the following command: dfx start --background Open a browser and navigate to the address and port number specified in the dfx.json configuration file. By default, the local canister execution environment binds to the 127.0.0.1:8000 address and port number. Add the required canisterId parameter and the Candid UI canister identifier returned by the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command to the URL. For example, the full URL should look similar to the following but with the CANDID-UI-CANISTER-IDENTIFIER that was returned by the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId= For instance, with the example canister identifier for the Candid UI as shown above, this could look as follows: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai The browser then displays a form for you to specify a canister identifier or choose a Candid description (.did) file. Note that this field refers to the canister identifier of the canister you would like to interact with (as opposed to the canister identifier for the Candid UI that we used in the last step). Specify the canister identifier of the canister you would like to test in the Provide a canister ID field, then click Go to display the service description. If you aren’t sure which canister identifier to use, you can run the dfx canister id command to look up the identifier for a specific canister name. For instance, to get the canister identifier for a canister named my_counter, you would use: dfx canister id my_counter Review the list of function calls and types defined in the dapp. Type a value of the appropriate type for a function or click Random to generate a value, then click Call or Query to see the result. Note that depending on the data type, the Candid interface might display additional configuration settings for testing functions. For example, if a function takes an array, you might need to specify the number of items in the array before entering values. After you finish experimenting with the dapp, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it does not continue running in the background. To stop the local canister execution environment: In the terminal that displays the operations, press Control-C to interrupt the process.

For this tutorial, the actor is named Counter. The program uses the currentValue variable to contain a natural number that represents the current value of the counter. This program supports the following function calls: The increment function call updates the current value, incrementing it by 1 (no return value). The get function call queries and returns the current value of the counter. The set function call updates the current value to an arbitrary numeric value you specify as an argument. This tutorial provides a simple example of how you can increment a counter by calling functions on a deployed canister smart contract. By calling the functions to increment and query the counter value multiple times, you can verify that the variable state—that is, the value of the variable between calls—persists. Before starting the tutorial, verify the following: You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have stopped any local canister execution environments running on the computer. This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. To create a new project directory for this tutorial: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using one. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new my_counter The command creates a new my_counter project for your project. Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd my_counter You have already seen that creating a new project adds a default dfx.json configuration file to your project directory. In this tutorial, you will modify the default settings to use a different name for the main program in your project. To modify the dfx.json configuration file: Open the dfx.json configuration file in a text editor and change the default main setting from main.mo to increment_counter.mo. For example: \"main\": \"src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo\", For this tutorial, changing the name of the source file from main.mo to increment_counter.mo simply illustrates how the setting in the dfx.json configuration file determines the source file to be compiled. In a more complex dapp, you might have multiple source files with dependencies that you need to manage using settings in the dfx.json configuration file. In a scenario like that—with multiple canister smart contracts and programs defined in your dfx.json file—having multiple files all named main.mo might be confusing. You can leave the rest of the default settings as they are. Save your change and close the dfx.json file to continue. Change the name of the main program file in the source code directory src to match the name specified in the dfx.json configuration file by running the following command mv src/my_counter/main.mo src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo So far, you have only changed the name of the main program for your project. The next step is to modify the code in the src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo file to define an actor named Counter and implement the increment, get, and set functions. To modify the default template source code: Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed. Open the src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the increment_counter.mo file: // Create a simple Counter actor. actor Counter { stable var currentValue : Nat = 0; // Increment the counter with the increment function. public func increment() : async () { currentValue += 1; }; // Read the counter value with a get function. public query func get() : async Nat { currentValue }; // Write an arbitrary value with a set function. public func set(n: Nat) : async () { currentValue := n; }; } Let’s take a closer look at this sample program: You can see that the currentValue variable declaration in this example includes the stable keyword to indicate the state—the value that can be set, incremented, and retrieved—persists. This keyword ensures that the value for the variable is unchanged when the program is upgraded. The declaration for the currentValue variable also specifies that its type is a natural number (Nat). The program includes two public update methods—the increment and set functions—and one a query method-the get function. For more information about stable and flexible variables, see Stable variables and upgrade methods in the Motoko Programming Language Guide. For more information about the differences between a query and an update, see Query and update methods in Canisters include both program and state. Save your changes and close the file to continue. Before you can build the my_counter project, you need to either connect to a local canister execution environment simulating the 互联网计算机 blockchain or to the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet. Starting the local canister execution environment requires a dfx.json file, so you should be sure you are in your project’s root directory. For this tutorial, you should have two separate terminal shells, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another. To start the local canister execution environment: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. You should now have two terminals open. You should have the project directory as your current working directory. Start the local canister execution environment on your computer by running the following command: dfx start After you start the local canister execution environment, the terminal displays messages about network operations. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your new project. After you connect to the local canister execution environment running in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp locally. To deploy the dapp locally: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Register, build, and deploy your dapp by running the following command: dfx deploy The dfx deploy command output displays information about the operations it performs. After successfully deploying the canister smart contract, you can simulate an end-user invoking the methods provided by the canister. For this tutorial, you invoke the get method to query the value of a counter, the increment method that increments the counter each time it is called, and the set method to pass an argument to update the counter to an arbitrary value you specify. To test invoking methods on the deployed canister smart contract: Run the following command to invoke the get function, which reads the current value of the currentValue variable on the deployed canister: dfx canister call my_counter get The command returns the current value of the currentValue variable as zero: (0 : nat) Run the following command to invoke the increment function to increment the value of the currentValue variable on the deployed canister by one: dfx canister call my_counter increment This command increments the value of the variable—changing its state—but does not return the result. Rerun the following command to get the current value of the currentValue variable on the deployed canister: dfx canister call my_counter get The command returns the updated value of the currentValue variable as one: (1 : nat) Run additional commands to experiment with invoking other methods and using different values. For example, try commands similar to the following to set and return the counter value: dfx canister call my_counter set '(987)' dfx canister call my_counter get This returns the updated value of the currentValue to be 987. Running the additional commands dfx canister call my_counter increment dfx canister call my_counter get returns the incremented currentValue of 988. The canister interface description language—often referred to as Candid or more generally as the IDL—provides a common language for specifying the signature of a canister smart contract. Candid provides a unified way for you to interact with canister smart contracts that are written in different languages or accessed using different tools. For example, Candid provides a consistent view of a service whether the underlying program is native Rust, JavaScript, or Motoko. Candid also enables different tools—such as the dfx command-line interface and the Network Nervous System dapp—to share a common description for a service. Based on the type signature of the actor, Candid also provides a web interface that allows you to call canister functions for testing and debugging. After you have deployed your project in the local canister execution environment using the dfx deploy or dfx canister install command, you can access the Candid web interface endpoint in a browser. This web interface—the Candid UI—exposes the service description in a form, enabling you to quickly view and test functions and experiment with entering different data types without writing any front-end code. To use the Candid web interface to test canister functions: Find the Candid UI canister identifier associated with the current project using the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command. dfx canister id __Candid_UI The command displays the canister identifier for the Candid UI with output similar to the following: r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai Copy the Candid UI canister identifier so that it is available in the clipboard. If you’ve stopped the local canister execution environment, restart it locally by running the following command: dfx start --background Open a browser and navigate to the address and port number specified in the dfx.json configuration file. By default, the local canister execution environment binds to the 127.0.0.1:8000 address and port number. Add the required canisterId parameter and the Candid UI canister identifier returned by the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command to the URL. For example, the full URL should look similar to the following but with the CANDID-UI-CANISTER-IDENTIFIER that was returned by the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId= For instance, with the example canister identifier for the Candid UI as shown above, this could look as follows: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai The browser then displays a form for you to specify a canister identifier or choose a Candid description (.did) file. Note that this field refers to the canister identifier of the canister you would like to interact with (as opposed to the canister identifier for the Candid UI that we used in the last step). Specify the canister identifier of the canister you would like to test in the Provide a canister ID field, then click Go to display the service description. If you aren’t sure which canister identifier to use, you can run the dfx canister id command to look up the identifier for a specific canister name. For instance, to get the canister identifier for a canister named my_counter, you would use: dfx canister id my_counter Review the list of function calls and types defined in the dapp. Type a value of the appropriate type for a function or click Random to generate a value, then click Call or Query to see the result. Note that depending on the data type, the Candid interface might display additional configuration settings for testing functions. For example, if a function takes an array, you might need to specify the number of items in the array before entering values. After you finish experimenting with your dapp, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background. To stop the local canister execution environment: In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local canister execution environment.

This tutorial illustrates using the React framework to create a new front-end for the default sample dapp and guides you through some basic modifications to customize the interface displayed. Later tutorials expand on the techniques introduced here, but if you already know how to use CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React or other frameworks to build your user interface, you can skip this tutorial. This tutorial illustrates using the React framework to manage the Document Object Model (DOM) for your canister smart contract. Because React has its own custom DOM syntax, you need to modify the webpack configuration to compile the front-end code, which is written in JSX. For more information about learning to use React and JSX, see Getting started on the React website. Before starting the tutorial, verify the following: You have node.js installed for front-end development and can install packages using npm install in your project. For information about installing node for your local operating system and package manager, see the Node website. You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for Motoko as described in Install the language editor plug-in if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE. You have stopped any DFINITY Canister SDK processes running on the local computer. This tutorial requires you to use the DFINITY Canister SDK version 0.8.0 or later. This tutorial takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. To create a new project directory for your custom front-end dapp: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using one. Check that you have node.js installed locally by running the following commands: which node which npm If you don’t have node.js installed, you should download and install it before continuing to the next step. For information about installing node for your local operating system and package manager, see the Node website. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new custom_greeting The dfx new custom_greeting command creates a new custom_greeting project. Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd custom_greeting If you’ve never used React before, you might want to explore the Intro to React tutorial or the React website before editing the front-end code. To install required framework modules: Install the React module by running the following command: npm install --save react react-dom Install the required TypeScript language compiler loader by running the following command: npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader As an alternative to installing these modules, you can edit the default package.json file to add dependencies for your project. { \"name\": \"custom_greeting_assets\", \"version\": \"0.1.0\", \"description\": \"Internet Computer starter application\", \"keywords\": [ \"Internet Computer\", \"Motoko\", \"JavaScript\", \"Canister\" ], \"scripts\": { \"build\": \"webpack\", \"prebuild\": \"npm run copy:types\", \"start\": \"webpack serve --mode development --env development\", \"prestart\": \"npm run copy:types\", \"copy:types\": \"rsync -avr .dfx/$(echo ${DFX_NETWORK:-'**'})/canisters/** --exclude='assets/' --exclude='idl/' --exclude='*.wasm' --delete src/declarations\" }, \"devDependencies\": { \"@dfinity/agent\": \"0.10.0\", \"@dfinity/candid\": \"0.10.0\", \"@dfinity/principal\": \"0.10.0\", \"assert\": \"2.0.0\", \"buffer\": \"6.0.3\", \"copy-webpack-plugin\": \"^9.0.1\", \"events\": \"3.3.0\", \"html-webpack-plugin\": \"5.3.1\", \"process\": \"0.11.10\", \"stream-browserify\": \"3.0.0\", \"terser-webpack-plugin\": \"5.1.1\", \"util\": \"0.12.3\", \"webpack\": \"5.24.4\", \"webpack-cli\": \"4.5.0\", \"webpack-dev-server\": \"^3.11.2\" }, \"browserslist\": [ \"last 2 chrome version\", \"last 2 firefox version\", \"last 2 safari version\", \"last 2 edge version\" ], \"dependencies\": { \"react\": \"^17.0.2\", \"react-dom\": \"^17.0.2\", \"ts-loader\": \"^9.2.3\", \"typescript\": \"^4.3.5\" } } Before we make any changes to use React for this tutorial, let’s review the default front-end settings in the dfx.json configuration file for your project. To review the default dfx.json configuration file: Open the dfx.json configuration file in a text editor. Notice that the canisters key includes settings for a custom_greeting_assets canister. { \"canisters\": { ... \"custom_greeting_assets\": { \"dependencies\": [ \"custom_greeting\" ], \"frontend\": { \"entrypoint\": \"src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.html\" }, \"source\": [ \"src/custom_greeting_assets/assets\", \"dist/custom_greeting_assets/\" ], \"type\": \"assets\" } } } Let’s take a look at the settings in this section. Front-end assets for your project are compiled into their own canister, in this case, a canister named custom_greeting_assets. The assets canister has a default dependency on the main canister for the project. The frontend.entrypoint setting specifies the path to a file—in this case, the index.html file—to use as your dapp entry point. If you had a different starting point—for example, a custom first-page.html file—you would modify this setting. The source settings specify the path to your src and dist directories. The src setting specifies the directory to use for static assets that will be included in your assets canister when you build your project. If you have custom cascading stylesheet (CSS) or JavaScript files, you would include them in the folder specified by this path. After building the project, the project assets are served from the directory specified by the dist setting. The type setting specifies that the custom_greeting_assets should use the certified asset canister, which comes with everything you need to host static assets on the 互联网计算机平台. For this tutorial, we are going to add React JavaScript in an index.jsx file, but that won’t require any changes to the default settings in the dfx.json file. Close the dfx.json file to continue. For this tutorial, you are going to make calls to the default main.mo canister through a custom front-end. Before you make any changes, though, let’s take a look at what’s in the default front-end files for a project. To review the default front-end files: Open the src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.html file in a text editor. This template file is the default front-end entry point for the dapp as specified by the frontend.entrypoint setting in the dfx.json file. This file contains standard HTML with references to a CSS file and an image that are located in the src/custom_greeting_assets/assets directory. The default index.html file also includes standard HTML syntax for displaying an input field for the name argument and a clickable button. This is the same default front-end you saw in Viewing the default front-end. Open the src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.js file in a text editor. import { custom_greeting } from \"../../declarations/custom_greeting\"; document.getElementById(\"clickMeBtn\").addEventListener(\"click\", async () => { const name = document.getElementById(\"name\").value.toString(); // Interact with custom_greeting actor, calling the greet method const greeting = await custom_greeting.greet(name); document.getElementById(\"greeting\").innerText = greeting; }); The import statement points to an actor that will allow us to make calls to our custom_greeting canister from \"../declarations\" The declarations haven’t been created yet, but we will come back to that. Close the index.js file to continue. You are now ready to create a new front-end for the default dapp. To prepare the front-end files: Open the webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js) in a text editor. Modify the front-end entry to replace the default index.html with index.jsx. entry: { // The frontend.entrypoint points to the HTML file for this build, so we need // to replace the extension to `.js`. index: path.join(__dirname, asset_entry).replace(/\\.html$/, \".jsx\"), }, Add the following module key above the plugins section: module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(js|ts)x?$/, loader: \"ts-loader\" } ] }, This setting enables the project to use the ts-loader compiler for a React JavaScript index.jsx file. Note that there’s a commented section in the default webpack.config.js file that you can modify to add the module key. Create a new file named tsconfig.json in the root directory for your project. Open the tsconfig.json file in a text editor, then copy and paste the following into the file: { \"compilerOptions\": { \"target\": \"es2018\", /* Specify ECMAScript target version: 'ES3' (default), 'ES5', 'ES2015', 'ES2016', 'ES2017', 'ES2018', 'ES2019' or 'ESNEXT'. */ \"lib\": [\"ES2018\", \"DOM\"], /* Specify library files to be included in the compilation. */ \"allowJs\": true, /* Allow javascript files to be compiled. */ \"jsx\": \"react\", /* Specify JSX code generation: 'preserve', 'react-native', or 'react'. */ }, \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"], } Save your changes and close the tsconfig.json file to continue. Open the default src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.js file in a text editor and delete lines 2 to 9. Copy and paste the following sample code into the index.js file: import * as React from \"react\"; import { render } from \"react-dom\"; import { custom_greeting } from \"../../declarations/custom_greeting\"; const MyHello = () => { const [name, setName] = React.useState(''); const [message, setMessage] = React.useState(''); async function doGreet() { const greeting = await custom_greeting.greet(name); setMessage(greeting); } return ( Greetings, from DFINITY! {\" \"} Type your message in the Name input field, then click{\" \"} Get Greeting to display the result. setName(ev.target.value)} > Get Greeting! Greeting is: \" {message}\" ); }; render(, document.getElementById(\"app\")); Rename the modified index.js file as index.jsx by running the following command: mv src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.js src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.jsx Open the default src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.html file in a text editor, then replace the body contents with . For example: custom_greeting Before you can build the custom_greeting project, you need to connect to either the live 互联网计算机平台, or a canister execution environment running locally in your development environment. To start the environment locally: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. Start the local canister execution environment on your local computer by running the following command: dfx start --background After the local canister execution environment completes its startup operations, you can continue to the next step. After you connect to the local canister execution environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp locally. To deploy the dapp locally: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Register, build, and deploy your dapp by running the following command: dfx deploy The dfx deploy command output displays information about the operations it performs. You can now access the new front-end for the default dapp by entering the canister identifier for the assets canister in a browser. To view the custom front-end: Open a new tab or window of your terminal and run npm start Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. Verify that you are prompted to type a greeting. For example: Replace Name in the input field with the text you want to display, then click Get Greeting to see the result. For example: After viewing the front-end, you might want to make some changes. To modify the front-end: Open the index.jsx file in a text editor and modify its style settings. For example, you might want to change the font family and use a placeholder for the input field by making changes similar to the following: import * as React from \"react\"; import { render } from \"react-dom\"; import { custom_greeting } from \"../../declarations/custom_greeting\"; const MyHello = () => { const [name, setName] = React.useState(''); const [message, setMessage] = React.useState(''); async function doGreet() { const greeting = await custom_greeting.greet(name); setMessage(greeting); } return ( Greetings, from DFINITY! {\" \"} Type your message in the Name input field, then click{\" \"} Get Greeting to display the result. setName(ev.target.value)} > Get Greeting! Greeting is: \" {message}\" ); }; render(, document.getElementById(\"app\")); Save the file and view the updated page in your browser. For example: Type a new message and see your new greeting. For example: After you finish experimenting with the front-end for your dapp, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background. To stop the local network: In the terminal that displays the webpack development server, press Control-C to interrupt the dev-server. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

As the next step in learning to write canisters that take advantage of actor-based messaging, this tutorial illustrates how to modify a traditional Hello, World! canister to define an actor, then deploy and test your canister on a local canister execution environment. Before starting the tutorial, verify the following: You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have stopped any local canister execution environment processes This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. To create a new project for this tutorial: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using one. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new actor_hello Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd actor_hello In the Exploring the default project tutorial, you saw that creating a new project adds a default dfx.json configuration file to your project directory. In this tutorial, you need to modify a few of the default settings to reflect your project. To modify the dfx.json configuration file: Open the dfx.json configuration file in a text editor. Check the default settings for the actor_hello project. Notice that the names and paths to source and output files all use the actor_hello project name. For example, the default canister smart contract name is actor_hello and the default path to the main code file is src/actor_hello/main.mo. You can rename any of these files or directories. If you make any changes, however, be sure that the names you use for your files and directories on the file system match the names you specify in the dfx.json configuration file. If you plan to use the default directory and file names, no changes are necessary. Remove all of the actor_hello_assets configuration settings from the file. The sample canister for this tutorial doesn’t use any front-end assets, so you can remove those settings from the configuration file. For example, the configuration file looks like this after you remove the actor_hello_assets section: { \"canisters\": { \"actor_hello\": { \"main\": \"src/actor_hello/main.mo\", \"type\": \"motoko\" } }, \"defaults\": { \"build\": { \"packtool\": \"\" } }, \"dfx\": \"0.8.2\", \"networks\": { \"local\": { \"bind\": \"127.0.0.1:8000\", \"type\": \"ephemeral\" } }, \"version\": 1 } Save your changes and close the file to continue. In the Exploring the default project tutorial, you saw that creating a new project creates a default src directory with a template main.mo file. In this tutorial, you modify the template code to create a simple \"Hello, World!\" canister. by defining an actor in Motoko. In Motoko, an 互联网计算机 canister is representeded as a Motoko actor. To modify the default template source code: Change to the source code directory for your project by running the following command: cd src/actor_hello Open the template main.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. The next step is to write a canister that prints a statement like the traditional \"Hello, World!\" sample canister. To compile the canister for the 互联网计算机, however, your Motoko code must define an actor. Copy and paste the following sample code into the main.mo file: import Debug \"mo:base/Debug\"; actor HelloActor { public query func hello() : async () { Debug.print (\"Hello, World from DFINITY \\n\"); } }; Let’s take a closer look at this Motoko actor defining our canister: The code imports a Debug module to provide the print functionality. The actor uses the public query func declaration to define an 互联网计算机 query method. Our method doesn’t need to make any permanent changes to the state of the actor. Declaring it as a query means that any changes it does make are transient and discarded after the query completes. For more information about using a query call, see query calls in Canisters include both program and state. Save your changes and close the main.mo file. Usually, in order to build a canister, it’s necessary to first reserve a unique canister identifier on the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet. However, it’s also possible to compile your program without connecting to the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet at all. The dfx build --check command uses a temporary, hard-coded canister identifier to accomplish this. To check that the canister builds: Navigate back to the root of your project directory. Build the canister executable with a temporary, hard-coded identifier by running the following command: dfx build --check The --check option enables you to build a project locally to verify that it compiles and to inspect the files produced. Because the dfx build --check command only uses a temporary identifier, you should see output similar to the following: Building canisters to check they build ok. Canister IDs might be hard coded. Building canisters... If the canister compiles successfully, you can inspect the output in the default .dfx/local/canisters directory and .dfx/local/canisters/actor_hello/ subdirectory. For example, you might use the tree command to review the files created: tree .dfx/local/canisters The command displays output similar to the following .dfx/local/canisters ├── actor_hello │ ├── actor_hello.d.ts │ ├── actor_hello.did │ ├── actor_hello.did.js │ ├── actor_hello.js │ └── actor_hello.wasm └── idl 2 directories, 5 files You cannot deploy the output from the dfx build --check command to a local canister execution environment or the 互联网计算机 mainnet. If you wanted to deploy this project, you would need to do the following: Connect to the either the local canister execution environment or 互联网计算机 mainnet. Register a connection-specific canister identifier. Deploy the canister. Let’s consider these steps in a bit more detail. Before you can deploy this project, you must connect to either your local canister execution environment, provided by dfx, or to the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet. After you connect to a local canister execution environment or 互联网计算机 mainnet, you must also generate a unique, connection-specific canister identifier to replace your locally-defined identifier. To see the steps involved for yourself, let’s deploy the project locally. To deploy this project locally: Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory, if needed. Start the local canister execution environment on your local computer by running the following command: dfx start --background For this tutorial, you can use the --background option to start the local canister execution environment as background processes. With this option, you can continue to the next step without opening another terminal shell on your local computer. Generate a new canister identifier for your project on the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx canister create actor_hello You should see output similar to the following: Creating a wallet canister on the local network. The wallet canister on the \"local\" network for user \"pubs-id\" is \"rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai\" Creating canister \"actor_hello\"... \"actor_hello\" canister created with canister id: \"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai\" The dfx canister create command also stores the connection-specific canister identifier in a canister_ids.json file in the .dfx/local directory. For example: { \"actor_hello\": { \"local\": \"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai\" } } Build the canister by running the following command: dfx build The command displays output similar to the following: Building canisters... Deploy your actor_hello project on the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx canister install actor_hello The command displays output similar to the following: Installing code for canister actor_hello, with canister_id rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai You now have a canister deployed on your local canister execution environment and can test your canister by using the dfx canister call command. To test the canister you have deployed on the local canister execution environment: Use dfx canister call to call the hello function by running the following command: dfx canister call actor_hello hello Verify that the command returns the text specified for the hello function along with a checkpoint message in the terminal running the local canister execution environment. For example, the canister displays \"Hello, World from DFINITY\" in output similar to the following: [Canister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai] Hello, World from DFINITY Note that if you are running the Internet Computer mainnet in a separate terminal instead of in the background, the \"Hello, World from DFINITY\" message is displayed in the terminal that displays mainnet activity. After you finish experimenting with your canister, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background. To stop the local canister execution environment, you can: In the terminal used to interact with your canister, issue the command dfx stop; or In the terminal that displays operations from the local canister execution environment, press Control-C to interrupt that process; or Kill the replica process using commands or tools of your operating system.

As a preview, the following diagram illustrates the development work flow when running the 互联网计算机 locally on you computer.

You have node.js installed if you want to include the default template files for front-end development in your project. You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for Motoko as described in Install the language editor plug-in if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE. You have stopped any local canister execution environment processes running on the local computer. This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. As discussed in the Quick start, dapps for the 互联网计算机 start as projects that you create. You can create projects using the dfx executable command-line interface (CLI). To take a closer look at the files and folders that are included in a project by default, let’s create a new project to work with. To create a new project: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Navigate to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using a separate working folder. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new explore_hello The dfx new explore_hello command creates a new explore_hello project, including a default project directory structure under the new project name and a new Git repository for your project. If you have node.js installed locally, creating a new project also adds some template front-end code and dependencies. To ensure that project names are valid when used in JavaScript, Motoko, and other contexts, you should only use alphanumeric characters and underscores. You cannot include dashes or any special characters. View the default directory structure by running the following command: ls -l explore_hello By default, the project directory structure includes at least one source subdirectory, a template README.md file, and a default dfx.json configuration file. Depending on whether you have node.js installed, your project directory might include some or all of the following files: explore_hello/ ├── README.md # default project documentation ├── dfx.json # project configuration file ├── node_modules # libraries for front-end development ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json ├── src # source files directory │ ├── explore_hello │ │ └── main.mo │ └── explore_hello_assets │ ├── assets │ │ ├── logo.png │ │ ├── main.css │ │ └── sample-asset.txt │ └── src │ ├── index.html │ └── index.js └── webpack.config.js At a minimum, the default project directory includes the following folders and files: A default README file for documenting your project in the repository. A default dfx.json configuration file to set configurable options for your project. A default src directory for all of the source files required by your dapp. The default src directory includes a template main.mo file that you can modify or replace to include your core programming logic. Because this tutorial focuses on the basics of getting started, you are only going to use the main.mo file. If you have node.js installed, your project directory includes additional files and directories that you can use to define the front-end interface for your dapp. Front-end development and the template files in the assets folder are discussed a little later. By default, creating a new project adds some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize the configuration settings for your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle. To review the default configuration file for your project: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd explore_hello Open the dfx.json configuration file in a text editor to review the default settings. For example: { \"canisters\": { \"explore_hello\": { \"main\": \"src/explore_hello/main.mo\", \"type\": \"motoko\" }, \"explore_hello_assets\": { \"dependencies\": [ \"explore_hello\" ], \"frontend\": { \"entrypoint\": \"src/explore_hello_assets/src/index.js\" }, \"source\": [ \"src/explore_hello_assets/assets\", \"dist/explore_hello_assets/\" ], \"type\": \"assets\" } }, \"defaults\": { \"build\": { \"packtool\": \"\" } }, \"dfx\": \"0.8.2\", \"networks\": { \"local\": { \"bind\": \"127.0.0.1:8000\", \"type\": \"ephemeral\" } }, \"version\": 1 } Let’s take a look at a few of the default settings. The settings section specifies the name of the WebAssembly module for your explore_hello project is explore_hello. The canisters.explore_hello key specifies that the main program to be compiled is located in the path specified by the main setting, in this case, src/explore_hello/main.mo and the type setting indicates that this is a motoko program. The canisters.explore_hello_assets key specifies configuration details about front-end assets for this project. Let’s skip those for now. The dfx setting is used to identify the version of the software used to create the project. The networks section specifies information about the networks to which you connect. The default settings bind the local canister execution environment to the local host address 127.0.0.1 and port 8000. If you have access to other 互联网计算机 network providers, the networks section can include network aliases and URLs for connecting to those providers. You can leave the default settings as they are. Close the dfx.json file to continue. New projects always include a template main.mo source code file. You can edit this file to include your own code to speed up the development cycle. Let’s take a look at the sample program in the default main.mo template file as a starting point for creating simple dapp using the Motoko programming language. To review the default sample program for your project: Check that you are still in your project directory by running the following command: pwd Open the src/explore_hello/main.mo file in a text editor and review the code in the template: actor { public func greet(name : Text) : async Text { return \"Hello, \" # name # \"!\"; }; }; Let’s take a look at a few key elements of this program: You might notice that this sample code defines an actor instead of a main function, which some programming languages require. For Motoko, the main function is implicit in the file itself. Although the traditional \"Hello, World!\" program illustrates how you can print a string using a print or println function, that traditional program would not represent a typical use case for Motoko dapps that run on the 互联网计算机. Instead of a print function, this sample program defines an actor with a public greet function that takes a name argument with a type of Text. The program then uses the async keyword to indicate that the program returns an asynchronous message consisting of a concatenated text string constructed using \"Hello, \", the # operator, the name argument, and \"!\". We’ll explore code that uses actor objects and asynchronous message handling more a little later. For now, you can continue to the next section. Close the main.mo file to continue. Before you can deploy the default project, you need to connect to either the local canister execution environment, or to the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet. Starting the local canister execution environment requires a dfx.json file, so you should be sure you are in your project’s root directory. For this tutorial, you should have two separate terminal shells, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another. To start the local canister execution environment: Open a new terminal window or a new terminal tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. You should now have two terminals open. You should have the project directory as your current working directory. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed. If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click Allow. After you start the local canister execution environment, you have one terminal that displays messages about network operations and another for performing project-related tasks. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to the terminal where you created your new project. After you connect to the local canister execution environment, you can register with the network to generate unique, network-specific canister identifiers for your project. In the Quick start tutorial, this step was performed as part of the dfx deploy command work flow. This tutorial demonstrates how to perform each of the operations independently. To register canister identifiers for the local network: Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed. Register unique canister identifiers for the canisters in the project by running the following command: dfx canister create --all The command displays the network-specific canister identifiers for the canisters defined in the dfx.json configuration file. Creating a wallet canister on the local network. The wallet canister on the \"local\" network for user \"pubs-id\" is \"rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai\" Creating canister \"explore_hello\"... \"explore_hello\" canister created with canister id: \"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai\" Creating canister \"explore_hello_assets\"... \"explore_hello_assets\" canister created with canister id: \"ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai\" Because you are connected to the local canister execution environment, these canister identifiers are only valid locally and are stored for the project in the .dfx/local/canister_ids.json file. For example: { \"explore_hello\": { \"local\": \"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai\" }, \"explore_hello_assets\": { \"local\": \"ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai\" } } Now that you have explored the default configuration settings and program code and have started the local canister execution environment, let’s compile the default program into an executable WebAssembly module. To build the program executable: In the terminal shell on your local computer, navigate to your explore_hello project directory. You must run the dfx build command from within the project directory structure. Build the executable canister by running the following command: dfx build You should see output similar to the following: Building canisters... Building frontend... Because you are connected to the local canister execution environment, the dfx build command adds the canisters directory under the .dfx/local/ directory for the project. Verify that the .dfx/local/canisters/explore_hello directory created by the dfx build command contains the WebAssembly and related application files by running the following command. ls -l .dfx/local/canisters/explore_hello/ For example, the command returns output similar to the following: -rw-r--r-- 1 pubs staff 178 Apr 6 14:25 explore_hello.d.ts -rw-r--r-- 1 pubs staff 41 Apr 6 14:25 explore_hello.did -rw-r--r-- 1 pubs staff 155 Apr 6 14:25 explore_hello.did.js -rw-r--r-- 1 pubs staff 142 Apr 6 14:25 explore_hello.js -rw-r--r-- 1 pubs staff 157613 Apr 6 14:25 explore_hello.wasm The canisters/explore_hello directory contains the following key files: The explore_hello.did file contains an interface description for your main dapp. The explore_hello.did.js file contains a JavaScript representation of the canister interface for the functions in your dapp. The explore_hello.js file contains a JavaScript representation of the canister interface for your dapp. The explore_hello.wasm file contains the compiled WebAssembly for the assets used in your project. The canisters/explore_hello_assets directory contains similar files to describe the front-end assets associated with your project. In addition to the files in the canisters/explore_hello and the canisters/explore_hello_assets directories, the dfx build command creates an idl directory. Verify that a new folder has been created, src/declarations. This folder will include copies of the folders from .dfx/local, except for the wasm. They do not contain any secrets, and we recommend committing these files along with the rest of your source code. You’ve seen that the dfx build command creates several artifacts in a canisters directory for your project. The WebAssembly modules and the canister_manifest.json file are required for your dapp to be deployed on the 互联网计算机 network. To deploy to the local canister execution environment: In a terminal shell on your local computer, navigate to your explore_hello project directory. Deploy your explore_hello project on the local network by running the following command: dfx canister install --all The command displays output similar to the following: Installing code for canister explore_hello, with canister_id rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai Installing code for canister explore_hello_assets, with canister_id ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai Authorizing our identity (pubs-id) to the asset canister...

Verify the command displays the return value of the greet function. For example: (\"Hello, everyone!\") If you have node.js installed in your development environment, your project includes a simple front-end example that uses a template index.js JavaScript file for accessing the explore_hello dapp in a browser. To explore the default front-end template: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open, and navigate to your explore_hello project directory. Open the src/explore_hello_assets/src/index.js file in a text editor and review the code in the template script: import { explore_hello } from \"../../declarations/explore_hello\"; document.getElementById(\"clickMeBtn\").addEventListener(\"click\", async () => { const name = document.getElementById(\"name\").value.toString(); // Interact with explore_hello actor, calling the greet method const greeting = await explore_hello.greet(name); document.getElementById(\"greeting\").innerText = greeting; }); The template index.js imports an explore_hello agent from our newly created declarations directory. The agent is automatically configured to interact with the interface we created in Main.mo, and makes calls to our canister using an AnonymousIdentity when the user clicks the greeting button. This file works in conjunction with the template index.html file to display an HTML page with an image asset, input field, and button for the greet function. Close the index.js file to continue. View the front-end assets created for the project by running following command: ls -l .dfx/local/canisters/explore_hello_assets/ The command displays output similar to the following: drwxr-xr-x 9 pubs staff 288 Apr 6 14:25 assets -r--r--r-- 1 pubs staff 2931 Dec 31 1969 assetstorage.did -r--r--r-- 1 pubs staff 265823 Dec 31 1969 assetstorage.wasm -rw-r--r-- 1 pubs staff 3651 Apr 6 14:25 explore_hello_assets.d.ts -rw-rw-rw- 1 pubs staff 2931 Dec 31 1969 explore_hello_assets.did -rw-r--r-- 1 pubs staff 4236 Apr 6 14:25 explore_hello_assets.did.js -rw-r--r-- 1 pubs staff 149 Apr 6 14:25 explore_hello_assets.js -rw-rw-rw- 1 pubs staff 265823 Dec 31 1969 explore_hello_assets.wasm These files were generated automatically by the dfx build command using node modules and the template index.js file. Start a development server with npm start. Open a browser and navigate to the local network address and port number—+127.0.0.1:8080 Verify that you see the HTML page for the sample application. For example: Type a greeting, then click Click Me to return the greeting. For example: After you finish experimenting with your dapp, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background. To stop the local canister execution environment: In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process. Stop the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx stop","title":"Explore the default project","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"explore-templates","url":"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/explore-templates.html","titles":[{"text":"Before you begin","id":"_before_you_begin"},{"text":"Create a new project","id":"create-a-new-project"},{"text":"Review the default configuration","id":"_review_the_default_configuration"},{"text":"Review the default program code","id":"_review_the_default_program_code"},{"text":"Start the local canister execution environment","id":"start-the-local-network"},{"text":"Register canister identifiers","id":"_register_canister_identifiers"},{"text":"Build the dapp","id":"_build_the_dapp"},{"text":"Deploy the project locally","id":"_deploy_the_project_locally"},{"text":"View the default front-end","id":"default-frontend"},{"text":"Stop the local canister execution environment","id":"_stop_the_local_canister_execution_environment"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/hello-location.html":{"text":"This tutorial provides a simple variation on the default program that lets you pass a single text argument to a single actor, compile the code to create a canister smart contract, then retrieve the argument. Throughout this document, the terms canister smart contract and canister are considered synonymous. This tutorial illustrates how to pass arguments on the command-line in a terminal using the Candid interface description language (IDL) and how to modify the program to allow it to accept more than one value for the text argument. Before you start this tutorial, verify the following: You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have stopped any canister execution environments running on the local computer. This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. To create a new project for this tutorial: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using one. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new location_hello Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd location_hello In the Explore the default project tutorial, you saw that creating a new project adds a default dfx.json configuration file to your project directory. You should always review the default settings in the file to verify the information accurately reflects the project settings you want to use. For this tutorial, you’ll modify the default configuration to remove settings that aren’t used. To modify settings in the dfx.json configuration file: Open the dfx.json configuration file in a text editor. Check the default settings for the location_hello project. Remove all of the unnecessary configuration settings. Because this tutorial does not involve creating any front-end assets, you can remove all of the location_hello_assets configuration settings from the file. Save your changes and close the file to continue. In the Explore the default project tutorial, you saw that creating a new project creates a default src directory with a template main.mo file. To modify the default template source code: Open the src/location_hello/main.mo source code file in a text editor. Modify the default source code to replace the greet function with a location function and the name argument with a city argument. For example: actor { public func location(city : Text) : async Text { return \"Hello, \" # city # \"!\"; }; }; Save your changes and close the file to continue. Before you can build your project, you need to connect to a local canister execution environment or the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet. Starting a canister execution environment locally requires a dfx.json file, so you should be sure you are in your project’s root directory. For this tutorial, you should have two separate terminal shells, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another. To start the local canister execution environment: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. You should now have two terminals open. You should have the project directory as your current working directory. Start the canister execution environment on your local computer by running the following command: dfx start If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click Allow. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your project. After you connect to the local canister execution environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp locally. To deploy the dapp locally: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Register, build, and deploy your application by running the following command: dfx deploy The dfx deploy command output displays information about the operations it performs. You now have a program deployed as a canister smart contract in your local canister execution environment and can test your program by using dfx canister call commands. To test the program you have deployed locally: Call the location method in the program and pass your city argument of type text by running the following command: dfx canister call location_hello location \"San Francisco\" Because the argument in this case includes a space between San and Francisco, you need to enclose the argument in quotes. The command displays output similar to the following: (\"Hello, San Francisco!\") If the argument did not contain a space that required enclosing the text inside of quotation marks, you could allow the Candid interface description language to infer the data type like this: dfx canister call location_hello location Paris Candid infers the data type as Text and returns the output from your program as text like this: (\"Hello, Paris!\") Call the location method in the program and pass your city argument explicitly using the Candid interface description language syntax for Text arguments: dfx canister call location_hello location '(\"San Francisco and Paris\")' The command displays output similar to the following: (\"Hello, San Francisco and Paris!\") Because your program only accepts a single text argument, specifying multiple strings returns only the first argument. For example, if you try this command: dfx canister call location_hello location '(\"San Francisco\",\"Paris\",\"Rome\")' Only the first argument—(\"Hello, San Francisco!\")—is returned. To extend what you have learned in this tutorial, you might want to try modifying the source code to return different results. For example, you might want to modify the location function to return multiple city names. To experiment with modifying the source code for this tutorial: Open the dfx.json configuration file in a text editor and change the default location_hello settings to favorite_cities. For this step, you should modify both the canister name and the path to the main program for the canister smart contract to use favorite_cities. Save your changes and close the dfx.json file to continue. Copy the location_hello source file directory to match the name specified in the dfx.json configuration file by running the following command: cp -r src/location_hello src/favorite_cities Open the src/favorite_cities/main.mo file in a text editor. Copy and paste the following code sample to replace the location function with two new functions. For example: actor { public func location(cities : [Text]) : async Text { return \"Hello, from \" # (debug_show cities) # \"!\"; }; public func location_pretty(cities : [Text]) : async Text { var str = \"Hello from \"; for (city in cities.vals()) { str := str # city #\", \"; }; return str # \"bon voyage!\"; } }; You might notice that Text in this code example is enclosed by square ([ ]) brackets. By itself, Text represents a collection of UTF-8 characters. The square brackets around a type indicate that it is an array of that type. In this context, therefore, [Text] indicates an array of a collection of UTF-8 characters, enabling the program to accept and return multiple text strings. The code sample also uses the basic format of an apply operation for the array, which can be abstracted as: public func apply(fs : [A -> B], xs : [A]) : [B] { var ys : [B] = []; for (f in fs.vals()) { ys := append(ys, map(f, xs)); }; ys; }; For information about the functions that perform operations on arrays, see the description of the Array module in the Motoko base library or the Motoko Programming Language Reference. For another example focused on the use of arrays, see Quicksort in the examples repository. Register, build, and deploy the dapp by running the following command: dfx deploy Call the location method in the program and pass your city argument using the Candid interface description syntax by running the following command: dfx canister call favorite_cities location '(vec {\"San Francisco\";\"Paris\";\"Rome\"})' The command uses the Candid interface description syntax (vec { val1; val2; val3; }) to return a vector of values. For more information about the Candid interface description language, see the Candid language guide. This command displays output similar to the following: (\"Hello, from [\"San Francisco\", \"Paris\", \"Rome\"]!\") Call the location_pretty method in the program and pass your city argument using the interface description syntax by running the following command: dfx canister call favorite_cities location_pretty '(vec {\"San Francisco\";\"Paris\";\"Rome\"})' The command displays output similar to the following: (\"Hello from San Francisco, Paris, Rome, bon voyage!\") The canister interface description language—often referred to as Candid or more generally as the IDL—provides a common language for specifying the signature of a canister smart contract. Candid provides a unified way for you to interact with canister smart contracts that are written in different languages or accessed using different tools. For example, Candid provides a consistent view of a service whether the underlying program is native Rust, JavaScript, or Motoko. Candid also enables different tools—such as the dfx command-line interface and the Network Nervous System dapp—to share a common description for a service. Based on the type signature of the actor, Candid also provides a web interface that allows you to call canister functions for testing and debugging. After you have deployed your project in the local canister execution environment using the dfx deploy or dfx canister install command, you can access the Candid web interface endpoint in a browser. This web interface—the Candid UI—exposes the service description in a form, enabling you to quickly view and test functions and experiment with entering different data types without writing any front-end code. To use the Candid web interface to test canister functions: Find the Candid UI canister identifier associated with the current project using the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command. dfx canister id __Candid_UI The command displays the canister identifier for the Candid UI with output similar to the following: r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai Copy the Candid UI canister identifier so that it is available in the clipboard. If you’ve stopped the local canister execution environment, restart it locally by running the following command: dfx start --background Open a browser and navigate to the address and port number specified in the dfx.json configuration file. By default, the local canister execution environment binds to the 127.0.0.1:8000 address and port number. Add the required canisterId parameter and the Candid UI canister identifier returned by the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command to the URL. For example, the full URL should look similar to the following but with the CANDID-UI-CANISTER-IDENTIFIER that was returned by the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId= For instance, with the example canister identifier for the Candid UI as shown above, this could look as follows: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai The browser then displays a form for you to specify a canister identifier or choose a Candid description (.did) file. Note that this field refers to the canister identifier of the canister you would like to interact with (as opposed to the canister identifier for the Candid UI that we used in the last step). Specify the canister identifier of the canister you would like to test in the Provide a canister ID field, then click Go to display the service description. If you aren’t sure which canister identifier to use, you can run the dfx canister id command to look up the identifier for a specific canister name. For instance, to get the canister identifier for a canister named my_counter, you would use: dfx canister id my_counter Review the list of function calls and types defined in the dapp. Type a value of the appropriate type for a function or click Random to generate a value, then click Call or Query to see the result. Note that depending on the data type, the Candid interface might display additional configuration settings for testing functions. For example, if a function takes an array, you might need to specify the number of items in the array before entering values. In this example, each function accepts an array of text strings. Therefore, you first select the length of the array, then set values for each item before clicking Call. After you finish experimenting with your program, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background. To stop the local canister execution environment: In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local process. Stop the canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx stop","title":"Pass text arguments","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"hello-location","url":"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/hello-location.html","titles":[{"text":"Before you begin","id":"_before_you_begin"},{"text":"Create a new project","id":"_create_a_new_project"},{"text":"Modify the default configuration","id":"_modify_the_default_configuration"},{"text":"Modify the default program","id":"_modify_the_default_program"},{"text":"Start the local canister execution environment","id":"_start_the_local_canister_execution_environment"},{"text":"Register, build, and deploy the dapp","id":"_register_build_and_deploy_the_dapp"},{"text":"Pass a text argument","id":"_pass_a_text_argument"},{"text":"Revise the source code in your program","id":"_revise_the_source_code_in_your_program"},{"text":"Test functions in a browser","id":"candid-ui"},{"text":"Stop the local canister execution environment","id":"_stop_the_local_canister_execution_environment"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/intercanister-calls.html":{"text":"One of the most important features of the 互联网计算机 blockchain for developers is the ability to call functions in one canister smart contract from another canister smart contract. This capability to make calls between canisters—also sometimes referred to as inter-canister calls—enables you to reuse and share functionality in multiple dapps. For example, you might want to create a dapp for professional networking, organizing community events, or hosting fundraising activities. Each of these dapps might have a social component that enables users to identify social relationships based on some criteria or shared interest, such as friends and family or current and former colleagues. To address this social component, you might want to create a single canister smart contract for storing user relationships then write your professional networking, community organizing, or fundraising application to import and call functions that are defined in the canister for social connections. You could then build additional applications to use the social connections canister smart contract or extend the features provided by the social connections canister to make it useful to an even broader community of other developers. The Motoko-based LinkedUp sample dapp provides a simple implementation of an open professional network that demonstrates how to use inter-canister calls within a project. The LinkedUp sample dapp is implemented using the following canister smart contracts: The linkedup canister smart contract creates and stores basic profile information for a user, including work experience and educational background. The connectd canister smart contract creates and stores a user’s connections. The linkedup_assets canister smart contract stores the front-end assets—including the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files—that define the user interface Before building the sample dapp, verify the following: You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have stopped the local canister execution environment provided by dfx. To experiment with inter-canister calls using the LinkedUp sample dapp: Open a terminal shell and change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 sample projects. Clone the linkedup repository. git clone https://github.com/dfinity/linkedup.git Change to the local working directory for the linkedup repository. cd linkedup Install node modules by running the following command: npm install If necessary, fix any vulnerabilities found by running the following command: npm audit fix Open the dfx.json file in a text editor and verify the dfx setting has same the version number as the dfx executable you have installed. For development purposes dfx provides a local canister execution environment. This requires a dfx.json file, so you should be sure you are in the linkedup root directory. To start the local canister execution environment: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start --background After the local canister execution environment completes its startup operations, you can continue to the next step. Once the local canister execution environment is up and running, you can generate unique canister identifiers for your project. To register canister identifiers: Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed. Register unique canister identifiers for the project by running the following command: dfx canister create --all The command displays the canister identifiers for the canisters defined in the dfx.json configuration file. \"connectd\" canister created with canister id: \"75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q\" \"linkedup\" canister created with canister id: \"cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q\" \"linkedup_assets\" canister created with canister id: \"7kncf-oidaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q\" Keep in mind that because you are running the local canister execution environment, these identifiers are only valid on the local canister execution environment. To deploy canisters on the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet, you must specify the appropriate target using the --network command-line option. To build and deploy the LinkUp sample dapp, take the following steps: Check that you are still in your project directory by running the pwd command, if necessary. Build the LinkedUp canister smart contracts by running the following command: dfx build Deploy the project on the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx canister install --all You should see canister identifiers for the connectd, linkedup and linkedup_assets canister smart contracts with a message similar to the following: Installing code for canister connectd, with canister_id 75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q Installing code for canister linkedup, with canister_id cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q Installing code for canister linkedup_assets, with canister_id 7kncf-oidaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q Copy the linkedup_assets canister identifier returned by the dfx canister install command. In this sample dapp, only the linkedup_assets canister smart contract includes the front-end assets used to access the dapp’s user interface. To open the dapp in a browser, therefore, you need to specify the linkedup_assets canister identifier. Open the linkedup_assets canister smart contract in your web browser. For example, if the local canister execution environment binds to the default localhost address and port number, the URL looks similar to this: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=7kncf-oidaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q To run through a demonstration of the LinkedUp sample dapp, take the following steps: Open a browser tab or window. Type the web server host name, port, and the canisterId keyword, then paste the linkedup_assets canister identifier as the URL to display. 127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId= The browser displays an introductory page. A public-private key pair will be automatically generated to establish your identity for accessing the canister smart contract, so there’s no need to provide a user name and password or register an account to store your identity before using the service. Click Login. The browser displays an empty profile page. Click Edit, type profile information, copy and paste the image address for an avatar photo, then click Submit. After you click Submit, you have a profile with some work history that can be viewed. For example: At this point, there are no other profiles to search for or to add as connections. To try out the Search and Connect features, you can: Run a script that populates the sample dapp with some additional profiles. Create a profile manually by opening a private window. For this tutorial, you will create another profile manually. To add a user profile with different identity: At the top right of the browser window, click the appropriate icon to display the browser’s menu options. For example, if you are using Google Chrome, click the vertical ellipse to display the More menu. Click New Incognito Window if you are using Google Chrome or New Private Window if you are using Firefox to enable you to navigate to the canister without the user identity generated in your initial browser connection to the canister. Copy and paste the URL from your first browser session into the private browsing window, then click Login. Notice that there’s no profile in the private browsing window but your original profile is still visible in your initial browser tab. Click Edit, type profile information, copy and paste the image address for an avatar photo, then click Submit. After clicking Submit, you have a second profile with some work history that can be viewed. For example: Type the first name or last name from the first profile you created—for example, if you created a profile for Maya Garcia, type Maya—then click Search. The profile matching your search criteria is displayed. Select the contact from the search results, wait for the Connect button to be displayed, then click Connect. When the connection request completes, the second profile displays the connection to the first profile. For example: Return to the browser tab with your original profile. If you want to create a connection between the original profile and the profile you created in the private browsing window, you can do so by repeating the search, select, and connect steps. Now that you have explored the basic features of the sample dapp, you have some context for exploring how the configuration settings and source files are used. To explore the configuration file: Change to the linkedup directory, then open the project’s dfx.json file. Note that there are two main canister smart contracts defined—connectd and linkedup—each with a main.mo source file. Note that the linkedup_assets canister smart contract specifies a frontend entry point of main.js and assets in the form of CSS and HTML files. Note that the dapp is configured to use the default IP address and port number for deployment on the local canister execution environment. The source code for the social connections canister smart contract, connectd, is organized into the following files: The digraph.mo file provides the functions to create a directed graph of vertices and edges to describe a user’s connections. The main.mo contains the actor and key functions for defining the connections associated with a user profile that can be called by the LinkedUp sample dapp. The types.mo file defines the custom type that maps a vertex to a user identity for use in the digraph and main program files. The source code for the professional profile with work history and educational background is organized into the following files: The main.mo file contains the actor and key functions for the LinkedUp sample dapp. The types.mo file defines the custom types that describe the user identity and profile fields that are imported and used in the main program file for the linkedup canister smart contract. The utils.mo file provides helper functions. In working with the LinkedUp sample dapp, you might notice that some operations—such as viewing a profile or performing a search—returned results almost immediately. Other operations—such as creating a profile or adding a connection—took a little longer. These differences in performance illustrate the difference between using query and update calls in the linkedup canister smart contract. For example, in the src/linkedup/main.mo file, the create and update functions are update calls that change the state of the canister smart contract and therefore need to go through consensus, but the program uses query calls for the get and search functions to view or search for a profile: // Profiles public shared(msg) func create(profile: NewProfile): async () { directory.createOne(msg.caller, profile); }; public shared(msg) func update(profile: Profile): async () { if(Utils.hasAccess(msg.caller, profile)) { directory.updateOne(profile.id, profile); }; }; public query func get(userId: UserId): async Profile { Utils.getProfile(directory, userId) }; public query func search(term: Text): async [Profile] { directory.findBy(term) }; In this sample dapp, the linkedup canister smart contract leverages functions defined in the connectd canister. This separation simplifies the code in each canister smart contract and, more importantly, illustrates how you can extend a project by calling common functions defined in one canister smart contract from one or more other canisters. To make the public functions defined in one canister smart contract available in the another canister smart contract: Add an import statement in the calling canister. In this example, the public functions are defined in the connectd canister smart contract and are called by the linkedup canister smart contract. Therefore, the src/linkedup/main.mo includes the following code: // Make the Connectd app's public methods available locally import Connectd \"canister:connectd\"; Use the canister.function syntax to call public methods in the imported canister smart contract. In this example, the linkedup canister smart contract calls the connect and getConnections function in the imported connectd canister smart contract. You can see the code that enables interaction between the linkedup canister smart contract and the connectd canister smart contract in the main.mo source files. For example, the src/connectd/main.mo defines the following functions: + actor Connectd { flexible var graph: Digraph.Digraph = Digraph.Digraph(); public func healthcheck(): async Bool { true }; public func connect(userA: Vertex, userB: Vertex): async () { graph.addEdge(userA, userB); }; public func getConnections(user: Vertex): async [Vertex] { graph.getAdjacent(user) }; }; Because of the Import statement, the connectd functions are available to the linkedup canister smart contract and the src/linkedup/main.mo includes the following code: // Connections public shared(msg) func connect(userId: UserId): async () { // Call Connectd's public methods without an API await Connectd.connect(msg.caller, userId); }; public func getConnections(userId: UserId): async [Profile] { let userIds = await Connectd.getConnections(userId); directory.findMany(userIds) }; public shared(msg) func isConnected(userId: UserId): async Bool { let userIds = await Connectd.getConnections(msg.caller); Utils.includes(userId, userIds) }; // User Auth public shared query(msg) func getOwnId(): async UserId { msg.caller } }; After you finish experimenting with the linkedup dapp, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background. To stop the local canister execution environment: In the terminal that displays the output of the local canister execution environment, press Control-C to interrupt the local process. Stop the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx stop","title":"Make inter-canister calls","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"intercanister-calls","url":"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/intercanister-calls.html","titles":[{"text":"Before you begin","id":"_before_you_begin"},{"text":"Download the demo","id":"_download_the_demo"},{"text":"Start the local canister execution environment","id":"_start_the_local_canister_execution_environment"},{"text":"Register canister identifiers","id":"_register_canister_identifiers"},{"text":"Build and deploy the demo project","id":"_build_and_deploy_the_demo_project"},{"text":"Create a profile and connections","id":"_create_a_profile_and_connections"},{"text":"Add another profile","id":"_add_another_profile"},{"text":"Explore the configuration file","id":"_explore_the_configuration_file"},{"text":"Explore the connectd source code","id":"_explore_the_connectd_source_code"},{"text":"Explore the linkedup source code","id":"_explore_the_linkedup_source_code"},{"text":"Query and update operations","id":"_query_and_update_operations"},{"text":"Interaction between the canister smart contracts","id":"_interaction_between_the_canister_smart_contracts"},{"text":"Stop the local canister execution environment","id":"_stop_the_local_canister_execution_environment"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/multiple-actors.html":{"text":"In this tutorial, you are going to create a project with multiple actors. Currently, you can only define one actor in a Motoko file and a single actor is always compiled to a single canister smart contract. You can, however, create projects that have multiple actors and can build multiple canisters from the same dfx.json configuration file. For this tutorial, you are going to create separate program files for three actors in the same project. This project defines the following unrelated actors: The assistant actor provides functions to add and show tasks in a to-do list. For simplicity, the code sample for this tutorial only includes the functions to add to-do items and to show the current list of to-do items that have been added. A more complete version of this canister—with additional functions for marking items as complete and removing items from the list—is available in the examples repository as Simple to-do checklist. The rock_paper_scissors actor provides a function for determining a winner in a hard-coded rock-paper-scissors contest. This code sample illustrates the basic use of switch and case in a Motoko program with hard-coded players and choices. The daemon actor provides mock functions for starting and stopping a daemon. This code sample simply assigns a variable and prints messages for demonstration purposes. Before starting the tutorial, verify the following: You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have stopped any local canister execution environment running on your computer. This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. To create a new project for this tutorial: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using one. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new multiple_actors Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd multiple_actors You have already seen that creating a new project adds a default dfx.json configuration file to your project directory. For this tutorial, you need to add sections to this file to specify the location of each canister that defines an actor you want to build. To modify the default dfx.json configuration file: Open the dfx.json configuration file in a text editor, then change the default multiple_actors canister name and source directory to assistant. For example, under the canisters key: \"assistant\": { \"main\": \"src/assistant/main.mo\", \"type\": \"motoko\" }, Because you are going to add settings to this canisters section of the configuration file, you must also add a comma after the curly brace that encloses the location of the assistant main source code file and the canister type. Remove the multiple_actors_assets section from the file. Add a new canister name, source code location, and canister type for the rock_paper_scissors canister and a new canister name, source code location, and canister type for the daemon program files below the assistant canister definition. After making the changes, the canisters section of the dfx.json file should look similar to this: { \"canisters\": { \"assistant\": { \"main\": \"src/assistant/main.mo\", \"type\": \"motoko\" }, \"rock_paper_scissors\": { \"main\": \"src/rock_paper_scissors/main.mo\", \"type\": \"motoko\" }, \"daemon\": { \"main\": \"src/daemon/main.mo\", \"type\": \"motoko\" } }, \"defaults\": { \"build\": { \"packtool\": \"\" } }, \"dfx\": \"0.8.2\", \"networks\": { \"local\": { \"bind\": \"127.0.0.1:8000\", \"type\": \"ephemeral\" } }, \"version\": 1 } You can leave the other sections as-is. Save your changes and close the dfx.json file to continue. Change the name of the default source file directory to match the name specified in the dfx.json configuration file by running the following command: cp -r src/multiple_actors/ src/assistant/ Copy the assistant source file directory to create the main canister file for the rock_paper_scissors actor by running the following command: cp -r src/assistant/ src/rock_paper_scissors/ Copy the assistant source file directory to create the main canister file for the daemon actor by running the following command: cp -r src/assistant/ src/daemon/ You now have three separate directories in the src directory, each with a template main.mo file. For this tutorial, you will replace the content in each template main.mo file with a different actor. To modify the default source code: Open the src/assistant/main.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file: import Array \"mo:base/Array\"; import Nat \"mo:base/Nat\"; // Define the actor actor Assistant { stable var todos : [ToDo] = []; stable var nextId : Nat = 1; // Define to-do item properties type ToDo = { id : Nat; description : Text; completed : Bool; }; // Add to-do item utility func add(todos : [ToDo], description : Text, id : Nat) : [ToDo] { let todo : ToDo = { id = id; description = description; completed = false; }; Array.append(todos, [todo]) }; // Show to-do item utility func show(todos : [ToDo]) : Text { var output : Text = \"\\n___TO-DOs___\"; for (todo : ToDo in todos.vals()) { output #= \"\\n(\" # Nat.toText(todo.id) # \") \" # todo.description; if (todo.completed) { output #= \" ✔\"; }; }; output }; public func addTodo (description : Text) : async () { todos := add(todos, description, nextId); nextId += 1; }; public query func showTodos () : async Text { show(todos) }; }; Save your changes and close the main.mo file to continue. Open the src/rock_paper_scissors/main.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file: import I \"mo:base/Iter\"; actor RockPaperScissors { stable var alice_score : Nat = 0; stable var bob_score : Nat = 0; stable var alice_last : Choice = #scissors; stable var bob_last : Choice = #rock; type Choice = { #rock; #paper; #scissors; }; public func contest() : async Text { for (i in I.range(0, 99)) { battle_round(); }; var winner = \"The contest was a draw\"; if (alice_score > bob_score) winner := \"Alice won\" else if (alice_score < bob_score) winner := \"Bob won\"; return (winner); }; func battle_round() : () { let a = alice(bob_last); let b = bob(alice_last); switch (a, b) { case (#rock, #scissors) alice_score += 1; case (#rock, #paper) bob_score += 1; case (#paper, #scissors) alice_score += 1; case (#paper, #rock) bob_score += 1; case (#scissors, #paper) alice_score += 1; case (#scissors, #rock) bob_score += 1; case (#rock, #rock) alice_score += 0; case (#paper, #paper) bob_score += 0; case (#scissors, #scissors) alice_score += 0; }; alice_last := a; bob_last := b; return (); }; // Hard-coded players and choices func bob(last : Choice) : Choice { return #paper; }; func alice(last : Choice) : Choice { return #rock; }; }; Save your changes and close the main.mo file to continue. Open the src/daemon/main.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file: actor Daemon { stable var running = false; public func launch() : async Text { running := true; debug_show \"The daemon process is running\"; }; public func stop(): async Text { running := false; debug_show \"The daemon is stopped\"; }; }; Save your changes and close the main.mo file to continue. Before you can install the multiple_actors project locally, you need to start your local canister execution environment. If you intend to deploy it to the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet, then you can skip this section. To start the local canister execution environment: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. Start the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx start Leave the terminal that displays canister execution operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your new project. To deploy the multi-canister dapp you need to register, build, and install the canisters either to the local canister execution environment or to the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet. To deploy the dapp locally: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Register, build, and deploy the application by running the following command: dfx deploy To deploy the dapp to the 互联网计算机 blockchain mainnet: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Run dfx deploy command specifying the --network option and the network alias configured in the dfx.json file. For example, if you are connecting to the 互联网计算机 mainnet using to the URL specified by the network alias ic you would run a command similar the following: dfx deploy --network ic The dfx deploy command output displays information about the operations it performs. For example, the command displays the specific canister identifiers for the three canisters defined in the dfx.json configuration file. Deploying all canisters. Creating canisters...

Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new contacts Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd contacts if you’ve never used React before, you might want to explore the Intro to React tutorial or the React website before editing the front-end code. To install required framework modules: Install the React module by running the following command: npm install --save react react-dom Install the required TypeScript language compiler loader by running the following command: npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader Install the required style loaders by running the following command: npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader If the npm install command reports a vulnerability, you might also want to run the npm audit fix command to attempt to fix the vulnerability reported before continuing. As an alternative to installing these modules, you can edit the default package.json file to add dependencies for your project. { \"name\": \"contacts_assets\", \"version\": \"0.1.0\", \"description\": \"\", \"keywords\": [], \"scripts\": { \"build\": \"webpack\" }, \"devDependencies\": { \"assert\": \"2.0.0\", \"buffer\": \"6.0.3\", \"css-loader\": \"^5.2.1\", \"events\": \"3.3.0\", \"html-webpack-plugin\": \"5.3.1\", \"process\": \"0.11.10\", \"stream-browserify\": \"3.0.0\", \"style-loader\": \"^2.0.0\", \"terser-webpack-plugin\": \"5.1.1\", \"ts-loader\": \"^8.1.0\", \"typescript\": \"^4.2.4\", \"util\": \"0.12.3\", \"webpack-cli\": \"4.5.0\", \"webpack\": \"5.24.4\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"@dfinity/agent\": \"0.10.0\", \"@dfinity/candid\": \"0.10.0\", \"@dfinity/principal\": \"0.10.0\", \"react-dom\": \"^17.0.2\", \"react\": \"^17.0.2\" } } The version of the JavaScript agent in this example package.json file is 0.10.0. In most cases, however, you would want to use the latest version of the agent available. When you create a new project, the dfx new command automatically retrieves the latest version of the JavaScript agent for you. You can also manually retrieve the latest version after creating a project by running the npm install --save @dfinity/agent command. For this tutorial, you are going to modify the main program to with code that allows you to store and look up contact information. To modify the default program: Open the src/contacts/main.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file: import List \"mo:base/List\"; import AssocList \"mo:base/AssocList\"; actor Contact { var contacts : ContactsMap = List.nil(); type Name = Text; type Phone = Nat; type Entry = { name : Name; address1 : Text; address2 : Text; email : Text; phone : Phone; }; type ContactsMap = AssocList.AssocList; func nameEq(lhs : Name, rhs : Name) : Bool { return lhs == rhs; }; public func insert(name : Name, address1 : Text, address2 : Text, email : Text, phone : Phone) : async () { let newEntry : Entry = { name; address1; address2; email; phone; }; let (newContacts, _) = AssocList.replace( contacts, name, func(n: Name, m: Name) : Bool { n == m }, ?newEntry ); contacts := newContacts; }; public query func lookup(name : Name) : async ?Entry { return AssocList.find(contacts, name, nameEq); }; }; Save your changes and close the main.mo file to continue. You are now ready to create a new front-end for your program. Open the webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js) in a text editor. Modify the front-end entry to replace the default index.html with index.jsx. entry: { // The frontend.entrypoint points to the HTML file for this build, so we need // to replace the extension to `.js`. index: path.join(__dirname, asset_entry).replace(/\\.html$/, \".jsx\"), }, Locate the commented example for the module key above the plugins section, then uncomment the following lines: module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(js|ts)x?$/, loader: \"ts-loader\" }, { test: /\\.css$/, use: ['style-loader','css-loader'] } ] }, These settings enable your program to use the ts-loader compiler and to import CSS files. Note: if you want to add support for .scss or .sass files, you should install sass-loader with: npm install --save react react-dom and then add this additional rule beneath the css-loader rule in webpack.config.js: module: { rules: [ // ... { test: /\\.s[ac]ss$/i, use: [ // Creates `style` nodes from JS strings \"style-loader\", // Translates CSS into CommonJS \"css-loader\", // Compiles Sass to CSS \"sass-loader\", ], }, ] }, Save your changes and close the webpack.config.js file to continue. Create a new file named tsconfig.json in the root directory for your project. Open the tsconfig.json file in a text editor, then copy and paste the following into the file: { \"compilerOptions\": { \"target\": \"es2018\", /* Specify ECMAScript target version: 'ES3' (default), 'ES5', 'ES2015', 'ES2016', 'ES2017', 'ES2018', 'ES2019' or 'ESNEXT'. */ \"lib\": [\"ES2018\", \"DOM\"], /* Specify library files to be included in the compilation. */ \"allowJs\": true, /* Allow javascript files to be compiled. */ \"jsx\": \"react\", /* Specify JSX code generation: 'preserve', 'react-native', or 'react'. */ }, \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"], } Save your changes and close the tsconfig.json file to continue. You are now ready to create a new cascading stylesheet and add it to your project. To add a stylesheet: Change to the src/contacts_assets/assets directory. cd src/contacts_assets/assets/ Open the main.css file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Define some style properties for the front-end. For example, copy and paste the following sample styles into the file: html { background-color: bisque; } body { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; display: block; margin: 10px; } h1 { color: darkblue; font-size: 32px; } div.new-entry { margin: 30px 20px 30px 20px; } .new-entry > div { margin-bottom: 15px; } table { margin-top: 12px; border-top: 1px solid darkblue; border-bottom: 1px solid darkblue; } #form { margin: 30px 0 30px 20px; } button { line-height: 20px; } #lookupName { margin-right: 12px; } Save your changes and close the main.css file to continue. Change to the src/contacts_assets/src directory. cd ../src Open the default index.js file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the index.js file: import * as React from \"react\"; import { render } from \"react-dom\"; import { contacts } from \"../../declarations/contacts\"; import \"../assets/mycontacts.css\"; const Contact = () => { async function doInsert() { let name = document.getElementById(\"newEntryName\").value; let add1 = document.getElementById(\"newEntryAddress1\").value; let add2 = document.getElementById(\"newEntryAddress2\").value; let email = document.getElementById(\"newEntryEmail\").value; let phone = document.getElementById(\"newEntryPhone\").value; contacts.insert(name, add1, add2, email, parseInt(phone, 10)); } async function lookup() { let name = document.getElementById(\"lookupName\").value; contacts.lookup(name).then((opt_entry) => { let entry; if (opt_entry.length == 0) { entry = { name: \"\", description: \"\", phone: \"\" }; } else { entry = opt_entry[0]; } document.getElementById(\"newEntryName\").value = entry.name; document.getElementById(\"newEntryAddress1\").value = entry.address1; document.getElementById(\"newEntryAddress2\").value = entry.address2; document.getElementById(\"newEntryEmail\").value = entry.email; document.getElementById(\"newEntryPhone\").value = entry.phone.toString(); }); } return ( My Contacts Add or update contact information: Name: Address 1 (street): Address 2 (city and state): Email: Phone: doInsert()}>Add Contact Lookup name:{\" \"} lookup()}>Lookup ); }; document.title = \"DFINITY CONTACT EXAMPLE\"; render(, document.getElementById(\"contacts\")); Rename the modified index.js file as index.jsx by running the following command: mv index.js index.jsx Open the default src/contacts_assets/src/index.html file in a text editor, then remove the main.css link and update the body contents with . For example: contacts Navigate back to the root of your project directory. For example: cd ../../.. Before you can build the contacts project, you need to connect to the local canister execution environment. To start the environment locally: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Start the local canister execution environment on your local computer by running the following command: dfx start --background After the environment completes its startup operations, you can continue to the next step. After you connect to the local canister execution environment in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp for testing. To deploy the dapp: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Register, build, and deploy your dapp by running the following command: dfx deploy The dfx deploy command output displays information about the operations it performs. Keep in mind that because you are running the canister execution environment locally, the identifiers displayed when you run the dfx deploy command are only valid on your machine. To deploy canisters on the 互联网计算机平台, you must specify that you are deploying to the 互联网计算机 and not your local environment by using the --network command-line option: dfx deploy --network=ic Start the Webpack development server: npm start You can now access the front-end for the contacts dapp. To view the front-end: Open a browser and navigate to the http://localhost:8080. Verify that you are prompted with a My Contacts form. For example: Create one or more test records by entering text in the Name, Address, and Email input fields and a number in the Phone input field, then clicking Add Contact. Clear the form fields and type a contact name in the Lookup name field, then click Lookup to see the stored contact information. Keep in mind that the Lookup name you type must be an exact match for the name of a contact you added. After viewing the Contacts dapp, you might want to make some changes. To change stylesheet properties: Open the src/contacts_assets/assets/mycontacts.css file in a text editor and modify its style settings. For example, you might want to change the background color or style the input form. You should see the changes update immediately in your open browser window. If you want to explore further, you might want to experiment with modifying the front-end or back-end code for this tutorial. For example, you might want try modifying the tutorial to do the following: Change the front-end code to clear the input fields after adding a new contact, for example, as part of an onClick event. Change the Motoko program functions to do partial instead of exact string matching on the Name field. (You will need to run dfx deploy to test your changes on the local environment) Change the Motoko program to allow lookups based on a different field. After you finish experimenting with your program, you can stop the local environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background. To stop the local development environment: In the terminal that displays your webpack dev server, press Control-C to interrupt the development server. Stop the 互联网计算机 network by running the following command: dfx stop","title":"Add a stylesheet","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"my-contacts","url":"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/my-contacts.html","titles":[{"text":"Before you begin","id":"_before_you_begin"},{"text":"Create a new project","id":"_create_a_new_project"},{"text":"Install the React framework","id":"_install_the_react_framework"},{"text":"Modify the default program","id":"_modify_the_default_program"},{"text":"Modify the front-end files","id":"_modify_the_front_end_files"},{"text":"Add a stylesheet to your project","id":"_add_a_stylesheet_to_your_project"},{"text":"Start the local network","id":"_start_the_local_network"},{"text":"Register, build, and deploy the dapp","id":"_register_build_and_deploy_the_dapp"},{"text":"View the front-end","id":"_view_the_front_end"},{"text":"Modify the stylesheet and test your changes","id":"_modify_the_stylesheet_and_test_your_changes"},{"text":"Modify the front-end or back-end code","id":"_modify_the_front_end_or_back_end_code"},{"text":"Stop the local canister execution environment","id":"_stop_the_local_canister_execution_environment"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/phonebook.html":{"text":"In this tutorial, you are going to write a simple dapp that enables you to store and look up telephone numbers. This tutorial illustrates how to import and use a few basic Motoko library functions. For this tutorial, the Motoko base library functions are defined in the List and AssocList modules and enable you to work with lists as linked key-value pairs. In this example, the key is a name and the value is the phone text string associated with that name. This dapp supports the following function calls: The insert function accepts the name and phone key-value pair as input stored in the book variable. The lookup function is a query that uses the specified name key as input to find the associated phone number. Before starting the tutorial, verify the following: You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have stopped the local canister execution environment provided by dfx. This tutorial takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. To create a new project for this tutorial: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using one. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new phonebook Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd phonebook For this tutorial, let’s create a new main.mo file for the simple phone number lookup dapp. To modify the default template: Open the src/phonebook/main.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the main.mo file: // Import standard library functions for lists import L \"mo:base/List\"; import A \"mo:base/AssocList\"; // The PhoneBook actor. actor { // Type aliases make the rest of the code easier to read. public type Name = Text; public type Phone = Text; // The actor maps names to phone numbers. flexible var book: A.AssocList = L.nil(); // An auxiliary function checks whether two names are equal. func nameEq(l: Name, r: Name): Bool { return l == r; }; // A shared invokable function that inserts a new entry // into the phone book or replaces the previous one. public func insert(name: Name, phone: Phone): async () { let (newBook, _) = A.replace(book, name, nameEq, ?phone); book := newBook; }; // A shared read-only query function that returns the (optional) // phone number corresponding to the person with the given name. public query func lookup(name: Name): async ?Phone { return A.find(book, name, nameEq); }; }; In looking at this sample dapp, you might notice the following key elements: The code defines Name and Phone as custom Text types. Creating user-defined types improves the readability of the code. The insert function is an update call and the lookup function is a query call. The Phone type is identified as an optional value by using the ?Phone syntax. For development purposes dfx provides a local canister execution environment. This requires a dfx.json file, so you should be sure you are in your project’s root directory. For this tutorial, you should have two separate terminal shells, so that you can start and see the output of the local canister execution environment in one terminal and manage your project in another. To start the local canister execution environment: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. You should now have two terminals open. You should have the project directory as your current working directory. Start the local canister execution environment on your local computer by running the following command: dfx start --clean For this tutorial, we’re using the --clean option to start the local canister execution environment in a clean state. This option removes any orphan background processes or canister identifiers that might disrupt normal operations. For example, if you forgot to issue a dfx stop when moving between projects, you might have a process running in the background or in another terminal. The --clean option ensures that you can start the local canister execution environment and continue to the next step without manually finding and terminating any running processes. Leave the terminal that displays the output of the local canister execution environment open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your new project. Once the local canister execution environment is up and running in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp onto it. To deploy the dapp locally: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Register, build, and deploy your dapp locally by running the following command: dfx deploy phonebook The dfx.json file provides default settings for creating a dapp front-end entry point and assets canister smart contract. In previous tutorials, we deleted the entries for the asset canister because we were not adding a front-end for the sample dapp. That change kept our project workspace tidy by eliminating files that would go unused. There is no requirement to do this, however, and there is no harm in leaving the asset canister smart contract description in the dfx.json file. For example, you might want to use it as a placeholder if you intend to add front-end assets later. For this tutorial, you can deploy just the phonebook back-end canister smart contract using the dfx deploy phonebook command because the project doesn’t include any front-end assets and you will interact with it via the terminal. Although this tutorial illustrates how to skip compiling a front-end canister, you can add a simple user interface to this dapp later by exploring the phone-book project in the examples repository. You now have a dapp deployed as a canister smart contract on your local canister execution environment and can test your dapp by using dfx canister call commands. To test the dapp you have deployed: Use the dfx canister call command to call the canister smart contract phonebook using the insert function and pass it a name and phone number by running the following command: dfx canister call phonebook insert '(\"Chris Lynn\", \"01 415 792 1333\")' Add a second name and number pair by running the following command: dfx canister call phonebook insert '(\"Maya Garcia\", \"01 408 395 7276\")' Verify that the command returns the number associated with \"Chris Lynn\" using the lookup function by running the following command: dfx canister call phonebook lookup '(\"Chris Lynn\")' The command returns output similar to the following: (opt \"01 415 792 1333\") Try to call the lookup function with the number associated with \"Maya Garcia\" by running the following command: dfx canister call phonebook lookup '(\"01 408 395 7276\")' Note that, in this case, the command returns (null) because the phone number is not a key associated with the \"Maya Garcia\" name entry. Try to call the lookup function again to return the phone numbers for both \"Maya Garcia\" and \"Chris Lynn\" by running the following command: dfx canister call phonebook lookup '(\"Maya Garcia\",\"Chris Lynn\")' Because the dapp is written to return one value for one key, the command only returns information associated with the first key, in this example the phone number for Maya Garcia. The canister interface description language—often referred to as Candid or more generally as the IDL—provides a common language for specifying the signature of a canister smart contract. Candid provides a unified way for you to interact with canister smart contracts that are written in different languages or accessed using different tools. For example, Candid provides a consistent view of a service whether the underlying program is native Rust, JavaScript, or Motoko. Candid also enables different tools—such as the dfx command-line interface and the Network Nervous System dapp—to share a common description for a service. Based on the type signature of the actor, Candid also provides a web interface that allows you to call canister functions for testing and debugging. After you have deployed your project in the local canister execution environment using the dfx deploy or dfx canister install command, you can access the Candid web interface endpoint in a browser. This web interface—the Candid UI—exposes the service description in a form, enabling you to quickly view and test functions and experiment with entering different data types without writing any front-end code. To use the Candid web interface to test canister functions: Find the Candid UI canister identifier associated with the current project using the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command. dfx canister id __Candid_UI The command displays the canister identifier for the Candid UI with output similar to the following: r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai Copy the Candid UI canister identifier so that it is available in the clipboard. If you’ve stopped the local canister execution environment, restart it locally by running the following command: dfx start --background Open a browser and navigate to the address and port number specified in the dfx.json configuration file. By default, the local canister execution environment binds to the 127.0.0.1:8000 address and port number. Add the required canisterId parameter and the Candid UI canister identifier returned by the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command to the URL. For example, the full URL should look similar to the following but with the CANDID-UI-CANISTER-IDENTIFIER that was returned by the dfx canister id __Candid_UI command: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId= For instance, with the example canister identifier for the Candid UI as shown above, this could look as follows: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai The browser then displays a form for you to specify a canister identifier or choose a Candid description (.did) file. Note that this field refers to the canister identifier of the canister you would like to interact with (as opposed to the canister identifier for the Candid UI that we used in the last step). Specify the canister identifier of the canister you would like to test in the Provide a canister ID field, then click Go to display the service description. If you aren’t sure which canister identifier to use, you can run the dfx canister id command to look up the identifier for a specific canister name. For instance, to get the canister identifier for a canister named my_counter, you would use: dfx canister id my_counter Review the list of function calls and types defined in the dapp. Type a value of the appropriate type for a function or click Random to generate a value, then click Call or Query to see the result. Note that depending on the data type, the Candid interface might display additional configuration settings for testing functions. For example, if a function takes an array, you might need to specify the number of items in the array before entering values. To extend what you have learned in this tutorial, you might want to try modifying the source code to return different results. For example, you might want to change the source code so that instead of a dapp that inserts and looks up a current key-value (name-phone) pair to create a dapp that stores contact information similar to a database \"record\" in which a primary key is associated with multiple fields. In this example, your dapp might enable users or another dapp to add information—such as a home phone number, a cell phone number, an email address, and a street address—and selectively return all or specific field values. After you finish experimenting with your dapp, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it does not continue running in the background. To stop the local canister execution environment: In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process. Stop the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx stop","title":"Import library modules","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"phonebook","url":"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/phonebook.html","titles":[{"text":"Before you begin","id":"_before_you_begin"},{"text":"Create a new project","id":"_create_a_new_project"},{"text":"Modify the default dapp","id":"_modify_the_default_dapp"},{"text":"Start the local canister execution environment","id":"_start_the_local_canister_execution_environment"},{"text":"Register, build, and deploy the dapp","id":"_register_build_and_deploy_the_dapp"},{"text":"Add names and numbers using the insert function","id":"_add_names_and_numbers_using_the_insert_function"},{"text":"Test functions in a browser","id":"candid-ui"},{"text":"Revise the source code in your dapp","id":"_revise_the_source_code_in_your_dapp"},{"text":"Stop the local canister execution environment","id":"_stop_the_local_canister_execution_environment"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/reproducible-builds.html":{"text":"Thanks to its consensus protocol, the 互联网计算机 always runs canisters' code correctly. But this doesn’t mean that it’s running the correct code for a canister. If you are using a canister somebody else developed, you may want to verify that the canister is indeed running some intended code before giving it control to make important decision for you, e.g., sending your ICP to a canister smart contract. Verifying this requires answering two questions: Which WebAssembly (Wasm) code is being executed for a canister? The canisters are normally written in a higher-level language, such as Motoko or Rust, and not directly in Wasm. The second question is then: is the Wasm that’s running really the result of compiling the purported source code? The rest of the document answers these questions. For the first question, we will see how the 互联网计算机 provides information about canister code. To be able to answer the second question, canister authors should ensure trusted and reproducible builds of the Wasm code from the source. Such builds allow anyone to follow the same steps as the canister authors and yield the exact same Wasm code, which can then be compared to the Wasm code executing in the canister on the 互联网计算机. The impatient reader who is familiar with the topic of reproducible builds can skip straight to the summary. 互联网计算机 does not allow you to access the Wasm code of an arbitrary canister. This is a design decision, as developers might want to keep some code private. However, the 互联网计算机 does allow you to access the SHA-256 of the Wasm code of a canister. To obtain this hash, you must first note the principal of the 互联网计算机 canister whose code you want to check. For example, assume we’re interested in the code of the Internet Identity canister, whose principal is rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai. Then, the easiest way to access this service is using the dfx tool from the terminal. Open your terminal, and run: $ dfx canister --no-wallet --network ic info rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai Controller: r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai Module hash: 0xda8d1bdd93fbf1edddeb2a423fa3c528c2e4877d39beed2277a12e60227e44d4 If you are running an older version of dfx, you will need to run this command from a directory that contains a valid dfx.json file. If you don’t have such a directory, you can create it using dfx new. Here, the 互联网计算机 tells us that the hash of the Wasm module of the rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai canister (which happens to be the Internet Identity canister) is 0xda8d1bdd93fbf1edddeb2a423fa3c528c2e4877d39beed2277a12e60227e44d4. The check above provides you the current hash of the canister’s Wasm module, but the controllers of an 互联网计算机 canister may change the code at any time (e.g., to upgrade a canister). However, if the list of controllers is empty, you know that the canister is immutable since nobody has the power to change the code. Armed with this hash, you can next check whether it corresponds to some given source code. This only works if the build process for the code is reproducible. As a canister author, there are a few things you have to provide to your users to allow them to reproduce your build: The same source code that you used to create the Wasm module for the canister. Instructions on how to recreate your build environment. Instructions on how to repeat the process of building the Wasm from the source code. Crucially, the process must be deterministic, to ensure that it results in the exact same Wasm. It also has to be trusted, such that the user can be convinced that the Wasm is a faithful translation of the source code, and not an artifact of a malicious build tool. We next look at each of these points in more detail. Typically, you will version your code in git or some other version control system, and your versioned code may be available in a public repository, e.g., GitHub. In this case, you should note the particular commit that you used when producing the code to be deployed to the 互联网计算机, and communicate it to the users who are trying to verify your canister. Alternatively, you can also provide a package (e.g., a zip file or a tarball) containing the source code you used to build your canister. Before building your code, you should document the build environment you are using in detail. In particular, for the languages supported by the 互联网计算机 SDK: Note down the operating system and its version you are using to build your canister. If you are using dfx, note the version used, as specified in dfx.json. You can install arbitrary versions of dfx using dfx toolchain install , or by running the installation script with the DFX_VERSION environment variable set to the desired version. If you are building Motoko code in a way other than dfx build, note the version of moc you are using. If you are building Rust, note the version of cargo you are using. If you are using Node.js and/or webpack for frontend development, note their versions. If your build process depends on any environment variables (such as the time zone or locale), note them down. You should communicate all of these to your user in the instructions. Ideally, do so by providing an executable recipe to recreate the build environment, using tools such as Docker or Nix. We recommend using Docker, as this allows you to also pinpoint the operating system used for building the software. Docker containers are a popular solution for providing build environments. You can use a Dockerfile such as the following to provide the user with a particular version of the operating system, as well as dfx, Node.js and the Rust toolchain. FROM ubuntu:20.10 # Install a basic environment needed for our build tools RUN \\ apt -yq update && \\ apt -yqq install --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates \\ build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev llvm-dev liblmdb-dev clang cmake # Install Node.js using nvm # Specify the Node version ENV NODE_VERSION=14.17.1 RUN curl --fail -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash ENV NVM_DIR=/root/.nvm RUN . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" && nvm install ${NODE_VERSION} RUN . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" && nvm use v${NODE_VERSION} RUN . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" && nvm alias default v${NODE_VERSION} ENV PATH=\"/root/.nvm/versions/node/v${NODE_VERSION}/bin/:${PATH}\" # Install Rust and Cargo in /opt # Specify the Rust toolchain version ARG rust_version=1.54.0 ENV RUSTUP_HOME=/opt/rustup \\ CARGO_HOME=/opt/cargo \\ PATH=/opt/cargo/bin:$PATH RUN curl --fail https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf \\ | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain ${rust_version}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --no-modify-path && \\ rustup default ${rust_version}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu && \\ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown # Install dfx; the version is picked up from the DFX_VERSION environment variable ENV DFX_VERSION=0.8.2 RUN sh -ci \"$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)\" COPY . /canister WORKDIR /canister There are a couple of things worth noting about this Dockerfile: It starts from an official Docker image. Furthermore, all the installed tools are standard, and come from standard sources. This provides the user with confidence that the build environment hasn’t been tampered with, and thus that the build process using Docker can be trusted. To ensure that specific versions of the build tools are installed, it installs them directly, rather than through apt (the package manager of Ubuntu, the Linux distribution running inside of the container). Such package managers usually don’t provide a way of pinning the build tools to specific versions. To use this Dockerfile, get Docker up and running, place the Dockerfile in the project directory of your canister, and create the Docker container by running: $ docker build -t mycanister . This creates a Docker container image called mycanister, with Node.js, Rust and dfx installed in it, and your canister source code copied to /canister (recall that you should invoke docker build from the canister project directory). You can then enter an interactive shell inside of your container by running: docker run -it --rm mycanister From here, you can experiment with the steps needed to build your canister. Once you are confident that the steps are deterministic, you can also put them in the Dockerfile, to allow the user to automatically reproduce your build when creating the canister. You can see an example in the Dockerfile of the Internet Identity canister. Next, we will investigate what is necessary to make the build deterministic. For the build process to be deterministic: You will need to ensure that any dependencies of your canister are always resolved in the same way. Most build tools now support a way of pinning dependencies to a particular version. For npm, running npm install will create a package-lock.json file with some fixed versions of all transitive dependencies of your project that satisfy the requirements specified in your package.json. However, npm install will overwrite the package-lock.json file every time it is invoked. Thus, once you are ready to create the final version of your canister, run npm install only once. After that, commit package-lock.json to your version control system. Finally, when checking the build for reproducibility, use npm ci instead of npm install. For Rust code, Cargo will automatically generate a Cargo.lock file with the fixed versions of your (transitive) dependencies. Like with package-lock.json, you should commit this file to your version control system once you are ready to produce the final version of your canister. Furthermore, Cargo by default ignores the locked versions of dependencies. Pass the --locked flag to the cargo command to ensure that the locked dependencies are used. You have to allocate canister IDs in advance, as canisters refer to each other by their IDs. Your own build scripts must not introduce non-determinism. Obvious sources of non-determinism include randomness, timestamps, concurrency, or code obfuscators. Less obvious sources include locales, absolute file paths, order of files in a directory, and remote URLs whose content can change. Furthermore, relying on third-party build plug-ins exposes you to any non-determinism introduced by these. Given the same dependencies and deterministic build scripts, the build tools themselves (moc for Motoko, cargo for Rust, webpack by default for front-end development) must also be deterministic. The good news is that all of these tools aim to be deterministic. However, they are complicated pieces of software, and ensuring determinism is non-trivial. Thus, non-determinism bugs can and do occur. For Rust, see the list of current potential non-determinism issues in Rust. Furthermore, we have observed differences between Rust code compiled to Wasm under Linux and MacOS, and thus recommend pinning the build platform and its version. For webpack, determinism is important to ensure caching, and webpack has since version 5 introduced deterministic naming of module and chunk IDs that you should use. The Motoko compiler aims to be deterministic and reproducible; if you find reproducibility issues, please submit a new issue, and we will try to address them to the extent possible. If reproducibility is vital for your code, you should test your builds to increase your confidence in their reproducibility. Such testing is non-trivial: we have seen real-world examples where non-determinism in a canister build took a month to show up! Fortunately, the Debian Reproducible Builds project created a tool called reprotest, which can help you automate reproducibility tests. It tests your build by running it in two different environments that differ in characteristics such as paths, time, file order, and others, and comparing the results. To use it, you can put the following Dockerfile in the root directory of your canister project. FROM ubuntu:20.10 # Install a basic environment needed for our build tools RUN \\ apt -yq update && \\ apt -yqq install --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates \\ build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev llvm-dev liblmdb-dev clang cmake # Install Node.js using nvm ENV NODE_VERSION=14.17.1 RUN curl --fail -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash ENV NVM_DIR=/root/.nvm RUN . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" && nvm install ${NODE_VERSION} RUN . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" && nvm use v${NODE_VERSION} RUN . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" && nvm alias default v${NODE_VERSION} ENV PATH=\"/root/.nvm/versions/node/v${NODE_VERSION}/bin/:${PATH}\"P # Install Rust and Cargo in /opt ARG rust_version=1.51.0 ENV RUSTUP_HOME=/opt/rustup \\ CARGO_HOME=/opt/cargo \\ PATH=/opt/cargo/bin:$PATH RUN curl --fail https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf \\ | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain ${rust_version}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --no-modify-path && \\ rustup default ${rust_version}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu && \\ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown # Install dfx; the version is picked up the DFX_VERSION environment variable ENV DFX_VERSION=0.8.2 RUN sh -ci \"$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)\" RUN apt -yqq install --no-install-recommends reprotest disorderfs faketime sudo wabt COPY . /canister WORKDIR /canister Next, create a canister_ids.json file containing the IDs of your canisters on the 互联网计算机, and put it in your project directory. Now, from the root directory of your canister project, you can test the reproducibility of your dfx builds as follows: $ docker build -t mycanister . ... $ docker run --rm --privileged -it mycanister root@6fe19d89f8f5:/canister# reprotest -vv \"dfx build --network ic\" '.dfx/ic/canisters/*/*.wasm' The first command builds the Docker canister using the above Dockerfile. The second one opens an interactive shell (hence the -it flags) in the canister. We run this in privileged mode (the --privileged flag), as reprotest uses kernel modules for some build environment variations. You can also run it in non-privileged mode by excluding some of the variations; see the reprotest manual. The --rm flag will destroy the canister after you close its shell. Finally, once inside of the canister, we launch reprotest in verbose mode (the -vv flags). You need to give it the build command you want to run as the first argument. Here, we assume that it’s dfx build --network ic - adjust it if you’re using a different build process. It will then run the build in two different environments. Finally, you need to tell reprotest which paths to compare at the end of the two builds. Here, we compare the Wasm code for all canisters, which is found in the .dfx/ic directory. If the comparison doesn’t find any differences, you will see an output similar to this one: No differences in ./.dfx/ic/canisters/*/*.wasm 27ff185372dbf51a860d6ddbe6fc9cbdd47cb41fba8c1b702bed9767cc34d66f ./.dfx/ic/canisters/Map/Map.wasm 6af1076f70407854cd6f62f23429d81f58398729f9ee5d4247ae4f93eb12770c ./.dfx/ic/canisters/Test/Test.wasm Congratulations - this is a good indicator that your build is not affected by your environment! Note that reprotest can’t check that your dependencies are pinned properly - use guidelines from the previous section for that. Moreover, we recommend you to run the container reprotest builds under several host operating systems and compare the results. If the comparison does find differences between the Wasm code produced in two builds, it will output a diff. You will then likely want to use the --store-dir flag of reprotest to store the outputs and the diff somewhere where you can analyze them. If you are struggling to achieve reproducibility, consider also using DetTrace, which is a container abstraction that tries to make arbitrary builds deterministic. Finally, even after you achieve reproducibility for your builds, there are still other things to consider for the long term. Reproducibility can be more demanding if you expect your canister canister code to stay around for years, and stay reproducible. The biggest challenges are to ensure that your: Build toolchain is still available in the future. Dependencies are avaiable. Toolchain still runs and still correctly builds your dependencies. Distributions and package archives may drop old versions of packages, including both your toolchain and their dependencies. Web sites may go offline and URLs might stop working. Thus, it’s prudent to back up all of your toolchain and dependencies. You should consider getting involved in projects such as Software Heritage, which do this on a large scale. At some later point in time, you might have to adjust your build process (e.g., by changing URLs) to ensure that your canister still builds. Even if the build changes, if it still yields the same result, your users can be confident that your canister is running the correct code. The trust argument is easier if your dependencies come from a trustworthy source, such as the Software Heritage project. Summarizing our recommendations for canister authors: Ideally, when producing the final version of your container code, use Docker or a similar technology to conveniently set up the operating system and the build tools, and fix their versions for the user. If the build tools you are using don’t guarantee fully reproducible builds, Docker can also help by minimizing the differences in paths, environment variables etc. The build tools and the base Docker image should be sourced from somewhere that the user can trust. Rust and Motoko compilers aim to be deterministic, and thus to support reproducible builds. If you notice non-determinism, file bug reports. When using NPM, ensure that you specify the exact versions of all your dependencies (commit package_lock.json to your git repo!). Invoke NPM using the ci command rather than install to reproduce the build. Similarly, for Rust packages commit Cargo.lock to your repository, and then use cargo build --locked when building the package. Webpack builds should be deterministic, but obfuscators and similar tools may compromise reproducibility. Make sure you use deterministic chunk and module IDs. Build tools aren’t perfect, and may fail to ensure reproducible builds. If reproducibility is critical for your canister (e.g., it holds other users' funds), test it. Reprotest is a useful tool for this purpose. Ideally, you want to minimize the number of dependencies, as, in order to do a full audit, the user may have to (reproducibly) rebuild all of your dependencies too. Achieving reproducibility is harder over longer time scales, primarily as you need to ensure that a trustworthy source of your dependencies and build tools stays available. Finally, if your build is reproducible, you can compare the hash of the resulting Wasm code to the hash of the code that is running in a canister, which you retrieve as follows: $ dfx canister --no-wallet --network ic info Beware that this hash might change if the controllers upgrade the canister code.","title":"Reproducible Canister Builds","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"reproducible-builds","url":"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/reproducible-builds.html","titles":[{"text":"Finding out which canister code the 互联网计算机 is executing","id":"_finding_out_which_canister_code_the_互联网计算机_is_executing"},{"text":"Reproducible builds","id":"_reproducible_builds"},{"text":"Providing source code","id":"_providing_source_code"},{"text":"Reproducing build environments","id":"_reproducing_build_environments"},{"text":"Build environments using Docker","id":"_build_environments_using_docker"},{"text":"Ensuring the determinism of the build process","id":"_ensuring_the_determinism_of_the_build_process"},{"text":"Testing reproducibility","id":"_testing_reproducibility"},{"text":"Long-term considerations","id":"_long_term_considerations"},{"text":"Summary","id":"_summary"}]},"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/scalability-cancan.html":{"text":"The CanCan sample application is a simplified video-sharing service that demonstrates several features that you can use as models for your own applications. For example, here are a few things you can learn by exploring the CanCan sample application: How to build a scalable application by splitting content into fragments for upload and storage then using queries to retrieve and reassemble the fragments for efficient streaming. How to configure interoperability for an application that uses canisters written in different back-end languages. How to implement a basic authentication model for storing videos uploaded by different users. How to build a front-end that implements more sophisticated user interface features for desktop or mobile apps. Because canisters are compiled WebAssembly modules, they have certain known limitations. For example, currently WebAssembly modules have a maximum of 4GB for memory and an upper limit on the number of object calls allowed. For a video-sharing sample applications like CanCan, these limitations mean that multiple canisters are required and that data must be broken into smaller chunks for storage and retrieval. The initial attempt to build a scalable video-sharing service for the 互联网计算机 used a distributed hash table (DHT) as a back-end service with simple get and put functions that distributed data—chunks of the video to be uploaded or streamed—into a predefined set of canisters. In the early phases of the project, this approach was sufficient for a proof-of-concept and verifying that the video data could be properly transcoded for storage and retrieval. However, the scalability of the application was limited because the distributed hash table relied on a specific number of canisters that it could populate with data for storage and retrieve data from for viewing. In addition, the original implementation of the distributed hash table back-end service included code to accommodate common network connectivity issues that could cause nodes to be unavailable or lose data. Because the 互联网计算机 protocol relies on replicated state across nodes in a subnet, it provides certain guarantees about fault tolerance and failover natively that are not generally available to applications running on other platforms or protocols. With the realization that the 互联网计算机 could ensure that canisters were available to receive and respond to requests,the original distributed hash table back-end service was replaced with a simpler but more scalable back-end service called BigMap. BigMap provides a simple, plug-in library for building scalable applications using key-value storage on the Internet Computer. By using the BigMap library as a back-end service, the CanCan sample application can dynamically chunk, serialize, and distribute data to multiple canisters. The library offers building blocks for application-specific, in-memory data abstractions that scale using any number of canisters. Each canister still has limited capacity, but the application instantiates the canisters it needs and keeps track of the fragments that make up the full video content for each user’s videos in an index file called the manifest. The code required for the BigMap service is much simpler than a traditional distributed hash table because the 互联网计算机 as a platform provides scalability, replication, failover, and fault tolerance. The BigMap service included in the CanCan sample application repository is written in the Rust programming language. However, the CanCan sample application also demonstrates interoperability between canisters written in different languages. In this case, the BigMap functionality is implemented using the Rust programming language and other services—such as encoding and decoding of video content and the management of user principals for authentication—are implemented using Motoko. By deploying different parts of the sample application as canisters, the interaction between them provides a seamless user experience. Although the BigMap service you see in the CanCan repository is written in Rust, the service was actually implemented in both Rust and Motoko programming languages to demonstrate the following: You can run both Motoko code and Rust code deployed as canisters on the 互联网计算机. You can switch between back-end languages without affecting the operation of the CanCan sample application. Both language implementation work seamlessly because the Candid language provides a common language for describing the BigMap API, independent of JavaScript, Rust, or Motoko. Much like the LinkedUp sample application, the CanCan sample application uses the public-private key pair, browser-based local storage, and the Principal data type to authenticate users. The CanCan sample application uses the React library in combination with TypeScript to implement front-end user interface. The application stores information about users and information about videos. To support most browsers, the videos are serialized into byte arrays with video data stored in 500kb segments of bytes that are referred to as Uint8Array objects. When a video is requested, the manifest loads the list of chunks required to play the video and concatenates the chunks before displaying the video in a standard element. User profiles are stored as profiles/{username} and are defined using the following data model: export interface Profile { username: string; // maya following: string[]; // [`alice`, `bob]` followers: string[]; // ['palice'] uploadedVideos: string[]; // ['profiles/maya/videos/a5b54646-2ea3-4e0e-82d1-da3ab8148df2'] likedVideos: string[]; // ['profiles/bob/videos/b74e4eb0-dea8-4a4a-a1ae-d4593dc86930'] avatar?: string; // ?ImageData (TODO) } Uploaded videos are identified by a unique identifier stored at profiles/{username}/videos/{videoId} and in public/videos (an array of all existing videos on the platform).

But what about the canister smart contracts that need to receive and use those cycles, e.g. to execute their functions and provide services to users? This tutorial provides a simple example to illustrate how you might add the functions to receive cycles and check your cycle balance to the default template program. This example consists of the following: The wallet_balance function enables you to check the current cycle balance for the canister. The wallet_receive function enables the program to accept cycles that are sent to the canister. The greet function accepts a text argument and displays a greeting in a terminal. The owner function returns the principal used by the message caller. Before starting the tutorial, verify the following: You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install. You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for Motoko as described in Install the language editor plug-in if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE. You have stopped any local canister execution environment running on the local computer. To create a new project directory for testing access control and switching user identities: Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open. Change to the folder you are using for your 互联网计算机 projects, if you are using one. Create a new project by running the following command: dfx new cycles_hello Change to your project directory by running the following command: cd cycles_hello For this tutorial, you are going to modify the template source code to include new functions for accepting cycles and checking the cycle balance. To modify the default program: Open the src/cycles_hello/main.mo file in a text editor and delete the existing content. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file: import Nat64 \"mo:base/Nat64\"; import Cycles \"mo:base/ExperimentalCycles\"; shared(msg) actor class HelloCycles ( capacity: Nat ) { var balance = 0; // Return the current cycle balance public shared(msg) func wallet_balance() : async Nat { return balance; }; // Return the cycles received up to the capacity allowed public func wallet_receive() : async { accepted: Nat64 } { let amount = Cycles.available(); let limit : Nat = capacity - balance; let accepted = if (amount <= limit) amount else limit; let deposit = Cycles.accept(accepted); assert (deposit == accepted); balance += accepted; { accepted = Nat64.fromNat(accepted) }; }; // Return the greeting public func greet(name : Text) : async Text { return \"Hello, \" # name # \"!\"; }; // Return the principal of the caller/user identity public shared(msg) func owner() : async Principal { let currentOwner = msg.caller; return currentOwner; }; }; Let’s take a look at a few key elements of this program: The program imports a Motoko base library—ExperimentalCycles—that provides basic functions for working with cycles. The program uses an actor class instead of a single actor so that it can have multiple actor instances to accept different cycle amounts up to a capacity for all instances. The capacity is passed as an argument to the actor class. The msg.caller identifies the principal associated with the call. Save your changes and close the main.mo file to continue. Before you can build the access_hello project, you need to connect to the canister execution environment running locally in your development environment, or you need to connect toa subnet that you can access. To start the local canister execution environment: Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. Start the local canister execution environment on your machine by running the following command: dfx start --clean --background After the local canister execution environment completes its startup operations, you can continue to the next step. After you connect to the local canister execution environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp locally. To deploy the dapp locally: Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed. Register, build, and deploy your dapp by running the following command: dfx deploy --argument '(360000000000)' This example sets the capacity for the canister to 360,000,000,000 cycles. The dfx deploy command output then displays information about the operations it performs, including the identity associated with the wallet canister created for this local project and the wallet canister identifier. For example: Deploying all canisters. Creating canisters... Creating canister \"cycles_hello\"... Creating the canister using the wallet canister... Creating a wallet canister on the local network. The wallet canister on the \"local\" network for user \"default\" is \"rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai\" \"cycles_hello\" canister created with canister id: \"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai\" Creating canister \"cycles_hello_assets\"... Creating the canister using the wallet canister... \"cycles_hello_assets\" canister created with canister id: \"ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai\" Building canisters... Building frontend... Installing canisters... Installing code for canister cycles_hello, with canister_id rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai Installing code for canister cycles_hello_assets, with canister_id ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai Authorizing our identity (default) to the asset canister... Uploading assets to asset canister... Deployed canisters. After you have deployed the dapp on your local canister execution environment, you can experiment with the wallet functions and test your program by using dfx canister call commands. To test the dapp: Check the principal for the default user identity by running the following command: dfx canister call cycles_hello owner The command displays output similar to the following for the current identity: (principal \"g3jww-sbmtm-gxsag-4mecu-72yc4-kef5v-euixq-og2kd-sav2v-p2sb3-pae\") If you haven’t made changes to the identity you were using to run the dfx deploy command, you should get the same principal by running the dfx identity get-principal command. This is important because you must be the owner of the wallet canister to perform certain tasks such as sending cycles or granting other custodian identities permission to send cycles. Check the initial wallet cycle balance by running the following command: dfx canister call cycles_hello wallet_balance You haven’t sent any cycles to the canister, so the command displays the following balance: (0) Send some cycles from your default wallet canister to the cycles_hello canister using the canister principal by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister call rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai wallet_send '(record { canister = principal \"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai\"; amount = (256000000000:nat64); } )' Call the wallet_balance function to see that the cycles_hello canister has the number of cycles you transferred, if you specified an amount under the allowed capacity, or the capacity you specified when you ran the dfx deploy command. dfx canister call cycles_hello wallet_balance The command displays output similar to the following: (256_000_000_000) Call the wallet_balance function to see the number of cycles in your default wallet by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister call rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai wallet_balance The command returns the balance for the wallet canister identifier you specified as a record using Candid format. For example, the command might display a record with an amount field (represented by the hash 3_573_748_184) and a balance of 97,738,624,621,042 cycles like this: (record { 3_573_748_184 = 97_738_624_621_042 }) For this simple tutorial, cycles are only consumed from the balance in the default wallet canister, not from the cycles_hello canister. Call the greet function by running a command similar to the following: dfx canister call cycles_hello greet '(\"from DFINITY\")' Rerun the call to the wallet_balance function to see the number of cycles deducted from your default wallet: dfx canister call rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai wallet_balance For example, you might a result similar to this: (record { 3_573_748_184 = 97_638_622_179_500 }) After you finish experimenting with the program, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background. To stop the local canister execution environment: In the terminal that displays the operations, press Control-C to interrupt the process. Stop the local canister execution environment by running the following command: dfx stop If you are looking for more information about working with cycles, check out the following related resources: Tokens and cycles (overview) dfx identity (command reference) Set an identity to own a canister (how-to) Managing cycles (language reference) ExperimentalCycles (base module)","title":"Accept cycles from a wallet","component":"docs","version":"master","name":"simple-cycles","url":"/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/simple-cycles.html","titles":[{"text":"Before you begin","id":"_before_you_begin"},{"text":"Create a new project","id":"_create_a_new_project"},{"text":"Modify the default program","id":"_modify_the_default_program"},{"text":"Start the local canister execution environment","id":"_start_the_local_canister_execution_environment"},{"text":"Register, build, and deploy the dapp","id":"_register_build_and_deploy_the_dapp"},{"text":"Test the dapp","id":"_test_the_dapp"},{"text":"Stop the local canister execution environment","id":"_stop_the_local_canister_execution_environment"},{"text":"Want to learn more?","id":"_want_to_learn_more"}]}}})
