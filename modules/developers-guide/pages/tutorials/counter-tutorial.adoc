在本章节中，将编写一个创建actor并提供几个函数来增加一个计数器的程序，同时会讲解如何维护一个值。

本章节中，actor被命名为Counter。程序使用 currentValue值来包含一个代表counter当前值的自然数。

这个程序会支持下面的函数调用：

* increment函数调用会将当前的值加1（无返回值）
* get函数会调用查询并返回当前的值
* set函数会将当前的值更新为用户输入的值

本章节提供一个简单的示例，展示如何在部署的Canister中调用函数来增加一个计数器。通过多次调用函数来增加值，可以验证变量状态和变量在调用之间的持续性。

== 开始之前

开始前，需要检查下面的问题：

* 已经按照[link:../../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[下载与安装章节]的步骤下载并安装了DFINITY Canister SDK
* 本地电脑上已经关闭了ICP网络进程

本篇教程需要大概20分钟。


== 创建新项目

创建项目步骤：

[arabic]
. 打开终端
. 进入工作目录
. 运行下面的命令来创建项目
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new my_counter
----
该命令会创建新的my_counter项目

. 进入项目目录
+
[source,bash]
----
cd my_counter
----

== Modify the default configuration

You have already seen that creating a new project adds a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to your project directory.
In this tutorial, you will modify the default settings to use a different name for the main program in your project.

To modify the `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor and change the default `+main+` setting from `+main.mo+` to `+increment_counter.mo+`.
+
For example:
+
[source,json]
----
"main": "src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo",
----
+
For this tutorial, changing the name of the source file from `+main.mo+` to `+increment_counter.mo+` simply illustrates how the setting in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file determines the source file to be compiled.
+
In a more complex dapp, you might have multiple source files with dependencies that you need to manage using settings in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
In a scenario like that—with multiple canister smart contracts and programs defined in your `dfx.json` file—having multiple files all named `main.mo` might be confusing.
+
You can leave the rest of the default settings as they are.
. Save your change and close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.
. Change the name of the main program file in the source code directory `+src+` to match the name specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file by running the following command
+
[source,bash]
----
mv src/my_counter/main.mo src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo
----

== Modify the default program

So far, you have only changed the name of the main program for your project.
The next step is to modify the code in the `+src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo+` file to define an actor named `+Counter+` and implement the `+increment+`, `+get+`, and `+set+` functions.

To modify the default template source code:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Open the `+src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+increment_counter.mo+` file:
+
[source.copy,motoko,no-repl]
----
include::example$counter.mo[]
----
+
Let's take a closer look at this sample program:
+
--

* You can see that the `+currentValue+` variable declaration in this example includes the `+stable+` keyword to indicate the state—the value that can be set, incremented, and retrieved—persists.
+
This keyword ensures that the value for the variable is unchanged when the program is upgraded. 
* The declaration for the `+currentValue+` variable also specifies that its type is a natural number (`+Nat+`).
* The program includes two public update methods—the `+increment+` and `+set+` functions—and one a query method-the `+get+` function.
--
+
For more information about stable and flexible variables, see link:../../language-guide/upgrades{outfilesuffix}[Stable variables and upgrade methods] in the link:../../language-guide/motoko{outfilesuffix}[_{proglang} Programming Language Guide_].
+
For more information about the differences between a query and an update, see link:../concepts/canisters-code{outfilesuffix}#query-update[Query and update methods] in link:../concepts/canisters-code{outfilesuffix}#canister-state[Canisters include both program and state].
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Start the local canister execution environment

Before you can build the `+my_counter+` project, you need to either connect to a local canister execution environment simulating the {IC} blockchain or to the {IC} blockchain mainnet. 

Starting the local canister execution environment requires a `+dfx.json+` file, so you should be sure you are in your project's root directory.
For this tutorial, you should have two separate terminal shells, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another.

To start the local canister execution environment:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer.
. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary.
+
--
* You should now have **two terminals** open.
* You should have the **project directory** as your **current working directory**.
--
. Start the local canister execution environment on your computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
After you start the local canister execution environment, the terminal displays messages about network operations.
. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your new project.

== Register, build, and deploy the dapp

After you connect to the local canister execution environment running in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp locally.

To deploy the dapp locally:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Register, build, and deploy your dapp by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.

== Invoke methods on the deployed canister smart contract

After successfully deploying the canister smart contract, you can simulate an end-user invoking the methods provided by the canister.
For this tutorial, you invoke the `+get+` method to query the value of a counter, the `+increment+` method that increments the counter each time it is called, and the `+set+` method to pass an argument to update the counter to an arbitrary value you specify.

To test invoking methods on the deployed canister smart contract:

[arabic]
. Run the following command to invoke the `+get+` function, which reads the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
The command returns the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable as zero:
+
....
(0 : nat)
....
[arabic]
. Run the following command to invoke the `+increment+` function to increment the value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister by one:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter increment
----
+
This command increments the value of the variable—changing its state—but does not return the result.
[arabic]
. Rerun the following command to get the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
The command returns the updated value of the `+currentValue+` variable as one:
+
....
(1 : nat)
....
[arabic]
. Run additional commands to experiment with invoking other methods and using different values.
+
For example, try commands similar to the following to set and return the counter value:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter set '(987)'
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
This returns the updated value of the `+currentValue+` to be 987.
Running the additional commands
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter increment
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
returns the incremented `+currentValue+` of 988.

== Stop the local canister execution environment

After you finish experimenting with your dapp, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local canister execution environment:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local canister execution environment.

. Stop the local canister execution environment by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
