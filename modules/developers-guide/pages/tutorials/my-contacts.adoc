CSS是一种常用的定制用户体验的方法。

本教程讲解了如何给React创建的项目添加样式表。

如果你已经了解了如何给React项目添加样式表，可以跳过本教程。

注意： 本教程说明了如何使用 React 框架来管理Canister的文档对象模型 (DOM)。 因为 React 有自己自定义的 DOM 语法，所以需要修改 webpack 配置来编译前端代码，前端代码是用 JSX 编写的。 有关学习使用 React 和 JSX 的更多信息, 请参考link:https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html[Getting started] 通过 https://reactjs.org/[React网站].

== 开始之前

开始之前，需要检查以下内容：

* 为前端开发安装了node.js并且可以使用npm install在项目中安装包。需要更多关于安装node和包管理器的信息，请查看link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node网站]
* 已经下载并安装了DFINITY Canister SDK
* 安装了Motoko 的VSCode 插件
* 终止了所有ICP网络进程

注意： 本教程要求使用0.8.0版本或更高版本的sdk

== 创建新项目

创建项目步骤

. 打开终端
. 进入工作目录
. 验证你已经安装了nodejs
. 运行下面的命令来创建项目 

+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new contacts
----

. 进入项目目录
+
[source,bash]
----
cd contacts
----

== Install the React framework

if you've never used React before, you might want to explore the link:https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html[Intro to React] tutorial or the link:https://reactjs.org/[React website] before editing the front-end code.

To install required framework modules:

. Install the React module by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save react react-dom
----
. Install the required TypeScript language compiler loader by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
----
. Install the required style loaders by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
----
+
If the `+npm install+` command reports a vulnerability, you might also want to run the `+npm audit fix+` command to attempt to fix the vulnerability reported before continuing.
+
NOTE: As an alternative to installing these modules, you can edit the default `+package.json+` file to add dependencies for your project.
+
....
include::example$add-stylesheet-package.json[]
....
+
The version of the JavaScript agent in this example `+package.json+` file is `+0.10.0+`. In most cases, however, you would want to use the latest version of the agent available. When you create a new project, the `+dfx new+` command automatically retrieves the latest version of the JavaScript agent for you. You can also manually retrieve the latest version after creating a project by running the `+npm install --save @dfinity/agent+` command.

== Modify the default program

For this tutorial, you are going to modify the main program to with code that allows you to store and look up contact information.

To modify the default program:

. Open the `+src/contacts/main.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file:
+
[source.copy,motoko,no-repl]
----
include::example$mycontacts/contacts.mo[]
----
. Save your changes and close the `+main.mo+` file to continue.

== Modify the front-end files

You are now ready to create a new front-end for your program.

. Open the webpack configuration file (`webpack.config.js`) in a text editor.
. Modify the front-end entry to replace the default index.html with index.jsx.
+
[source,js]
----
entry: {
  // The frontend.entrypoint points to the HTML file for this build, so we need
  // to replace the extension to `.js`.
  index: path.join(__dirname, asset_entry).replace(/\.html$/, ".jsx"),
},
----
. Locate the commented example for the `+module+` key above the `+plugins+` section, then uncomment the following lines:
+
[source,js]
----
module: {
  rules: [
    { test: /\.(js|ts)x?$/, loader: "ts-loader" },
    { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader','css-loader'] }
  ]
},
----
+
. These settings enable your program to use the `+ts-loader+` compiler and to import CSS files.
+
Note: if you want to add support for `+.scss+` or `+.sass+` files, you should install `+sass-loader+` with:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save react react-dom
----
+ 
and then add this additional rule beneath the `+css-loader+` rule in `+webpack.config.js+`:
+
[source,js]
----
module: {
  rules: [
    // ...
    {
      test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
      use: [
        // Creates `style` nodes from JS strings
        "style-loader",
        // Translates CSS into CommonJS
        "css-loader",
        // Compiles Sass to CSS
        "sass-loader",
      ],
    },
  ]
},
----

. Save your changes and close the `+webpack.config.js+` file to continue.
. Create a new file named `+tsconfig.json+` in the root directory for your project.
. Open the `+tsconfig.json+` file in a text editor, then copy and paste the following into the file:
+
[source,json]
----
include::example$sample-tsconfig.json[]
----
. Save your changes and close the `+tsconfig.json+` file to continue.

== Add a stylesheet to your project

You are now ready to create a new cascading stylesheet and add it to your project.

To add a stylesheet:

. Change to the `+src/contacts_assets/assets+` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd src/contacts_assets/assets/
----
. Open the `+main.css+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Define some style properties for the front-end.
+
For example, copy and paste the following sample styles into the file:
+
[source,bash]
----
include::example$mycontacts/mycontacts.css[]
----
. Save your changes and close the `+main.css+` file to continue.
. Change to the `+src/contacts_assets/src+` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ../src
----
. Open the default `+index.js+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+index.js+` file:
+
[source,react]
----
include::example$mycontacts/mod-index.jsx[]
----
. Rename the modified `index.js` file as `index.jsx` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mv index.js index.jsx
----
. Open the default `src/contacts_assets/src/index.html` file in a text editor, then remove the `main.css` link and update the `body` contents with `<div id="contacts"></div>`.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>contacts</title>
    <base href="/" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <div id="contacts"></div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
----
. Navigate back to the root of your project directory.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ../../..
----

== Start the local network

Before you can build the `+contacts+` project, you need to connect to the local canister execution environment.

To start the environment locally:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer.
. Start the local canister execution environment on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
+
After the environment completes its startup operations, you can continue to the next step.

== Register, build, and deploy the dapp

After you connect to the local canister execution environment in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp for testing.

To deploy the dapp:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Register, build, and deploy your dapp by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.
+
Keep in mind that because you are running the canister execution environment locally, the identifiers displayed when you run the `+dfx deploy+` command are only valid on your machine.
+
To deploy canisters on the {platform}, you must specify that you are deploying to the {IC} and not your local environment by using the `+--network+` command-line option:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy --network=ic
----
. Start the Webpack development server:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm start
----

== View the front-end

You can now access the front-end for the `+contacts+` dapp.

To view the front-end:

. Open a browser and navigate to the `http://localhost:8080`.
. Verify that you are prompted with a **My Contacts** form.
+
For example:
+
image:mycontacts-form.png[Sample front-end]

. Create one or more test records by entering text in the Name, Address, and Email input fields and a number in the Phone input field, then clicking *Add Contact*.
. Clear the form fields and type a contact name in the Lookup name field, then click *Lookup* to see the stored contact information.
+
Keep in mind that the *Lookup name* you type must be an exact match for the name of a contact you added.

== Modify the stylesheet and test your changes

After viewing the Contacts dapp, you might want to make some changes.

To change stylesheet properties:

. Open the `+src/contacts_assets/assets/mycontacts.css+` file in a text editor and modify its style settings.
+
For example, you might want to change the background color or style the input form.
+
You should see the changes update immediately in your open browser window.

== Modify the front-end or back-end code

If you want to explore further, you might want to experiment with modifying the front-end or back-end code for this tutorial.
For example, you might want try modifying the tutorial to do the following:

- Change the front-end code to clear the input fields after adding a new contact, for example, as part of an `+onClick+` event.
- Change the {proglang} program functions to do partial instead of exact string matching on the `+Name+` field. (You will need to run `dfx deploy` to test your changes on the local environment)
- Change the {proglang} program to allow lookups based on a different field.

== Stop the local canister execution environment

After you finish experimenting with your program, you can stop the local environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local development environment:

. In the terminal that displays your webpack dev server, press Control-C to interrupt the development server.

. Stop the {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
